'''Physical strength''' is the measure of a [[human]]'s exertion of [[force]] on [[physical object]]s. Increasing physical strength is the goal of [[strength training]].

==Overview==
An individual's physical strength is determined by two factors: the cross-sectional area of muscle fibers recruited to generate force and the intensity of the recruitment. Individuals with a high proportion of [[Muscle fibre#Type I|type I]] slow twitch muscle fibers will be relatively weaker than a similar individual with a high proportion of [[Muscle fibre#Type II|type II]] fast twitch fibers, but would have a greater inherent capacity for physical endurance. The genetic inheritance of muscle fiber type sets the outermost boundaries of physical strength possible (barring the use of enhancing agents such as [[testosterone]]), though the unique position within this envelope is determined by training. Individual muscle fiber ratios can be determined through a muscle biopsy. Other considerations are the ability to recruit muscle fibers for a particular activity, joint angles, and the length of each limb. For a given cross-section, shorter limbs are able to lift more weight. The ability to gain muscle also varies person to person, based mainly upon genes dictating the amounts of hormones secreted, but also on sex, age, health of the person, and adequate nutrients in the diet. A [[one-repetition maximum]] test is the most accurate way to determine maximum muscular strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hprc-online.org/physical-fitness/training-exercise/exercise/muscular-fitness-and-flexibility/muscular-strength|title=Muscular Strength — Human Performance Resource Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ahealthyphilosophy.com/article/muscular-strength|title=Muscular Strength}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strength capability==
There are various ways to measure physical strength of a person or population. Strength capability analysis is usually done in the field of [[ergonomics]] where a particular task (e.g. lifting a load, pushing a cart, etc.) and/or a posture is evaluated and compared to the capabilities of the section of the population that the task is intended towards. The external reactive [[torque|moments]] and forces on the joints are usually used in such cases. The strength capability of the joint is denoted by the amount of moment that the muscle force can create at the joint to counter the external moment.

Skeletal muscles produce reactive forces and moments at the joints. To avoid injury or fatigue, when person is performing a task, such as pushing or lifting a load, the external moments created at the joints due to the load at the hand and the weight of the body segments must be ideally less than the muscular moment strengths at the joint.

One of the first [[sagittal plane|sagittal-plane]] models to predict strength was developed by Chaffin in 1969.&lt;ref name = Chaffin&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Chaffin DB, Andersson GB, Martin BJ |title= Occupational Biomechanics, 3rd Edition |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |location=New York |year=1999 |isbn=0-471-24697-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on this model, the external moments at each joint must not exceed the muscle strength moments at that joint.

'''&lt;center&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;j/L&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;'''

Where, S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; is the muscle strength moment at joint, j, and M&lt;sub&gt;j/L&lt;/sub&gt; is the external moment at the joint, j, due to load, L and the body segments preceding the joint in the top-down analysis.

Top-down analysis is the method of calculating the reactive moments and forces at each joint starting at the hand, all the way till the ankle and foot. In a 6-segment model, the joints considered are elbow, shoulder, L5/S1 [[vertebral column|disc of the spine]], hip, knee and ankle. It is common to ignore the wrist joint in manual calculations. Software intended for such calculation use the wrist joint also, dividing the lower arm into hand and forearm segments.

==Prediction of static strength==
Static strength prediction is the method of predicting the strength capabilities of a person or a population (based on anthropometry) for a particular task and/or posture (an [[Isometric exercise|isometric contraction]]). Manual calculations are usually performed using the top-down analysis on a six or seven-link model, based on available information about the case and then compared to standard guidelines, such as the one provided by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], to predict capability.

[[File:Överspagat.jpg|thumb|An [[Split (gymnastics)|oversplit]] by former Olympic gymnast [[Irina Tchachina]]]]
[[File:Stretching cat.jpg|thumb|[[Stretching]] cat]]

'''Flexibility''' or '''limberness''' refers to the [[range of motion|range of movement]] in a [[joint]] or series of joints, and length in muscles that cross the joints to induce a bending movement or motion. Flexibility varies between individuals, particularly in terms of differences in muscle length of multi-joint muscles.  Flexibility in some joints can be increased to a certain degree by exercise, with [[stretching]] a common exercise component to maintain or improve flexibility.

[[Hypermobility (joints)|Hypermobility]], also known as double-jointedness, describes [[joint]]s that stretch farther than normal.

==Anatomical elements==

===Joints===
[[File:Gym 3 - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 11-August 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|Man stretching]]
{{Main|Joint}}
The joints in a human body are surrounded by [[synovial membranes]] and [[articular cartilage]] which cover, cushion and nourish the joint and surfaces of each.&lt;ref&gt;Blakey (1994), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing muscular elasticity of the joint's range of mobility increases [[flexibility]].

===Ligaments===
{{Main|Ligament}}
Ligaments are composed of two different tissues: white and yellow. The white [[fibrous tissues]] are not stretchy, but are extremely strong so that even if the bone were fractured the tissue would remain in place. The white tissue allows subjective freedom of movement. The yellow [[elastic tissue]] can be stretched considerably and return to its original length.

===Tendons===
{{Main|Tendon}}
Tendons are not elastic and are even less stretchy. Tendons are categorized as a [[connective tissue]]. Connective tissue supports, surrounds, and binds the [[muscle fibres]]. They contain both elastic and non-elastic tissue.

===Areolar tissue===
[[File:Lion stretching at Ouwehands 2010.JPG|thumb|Stretching [[lion]]]]
The [[areolar tissue]] is permeable and is extensively distributed throughout the body.  This tissue acts as a general binder for all other tissues.&lt;ref&gt;Blakey (1994), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muscle tissue===
{{Main|Muscle}}
Muscle tissue is made of a stretchy material. It is arranged in bundles of parallel fibres.&lt;ref&gt;Blakey (1994), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stretch receptors===
[[Mechanoreceptors|Stretch receptors]] have two parts: [[Spindle cells]] and Golgi tendons. Spindle cells, located in the center of a muscle, send messages for the muscle to contract.&lt;ref&gt;Blakey (1994), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Golgi tendon receptors are located near the end of a muscle fiber and send messages for the muscle to relax. As these receptors are trained through continual use, stretching becomes easier. When reflexes that inhibit flexibility are released the splits then become easier to perform. The splits use the body's complete range of motion and provide a complete stretch.

==Stretching==
[[File:Drew Bledsoe stretching.jpg|thumb|A stretching [[American football]] player]]
{{Main|Stretching}}
Flexibility is improved by stretching.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley (2004), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Stretching should only be started when muscles are warm and the body temperature is raised. To be effective while stretching, force applied to the body must be held just beyond a feeling of pain and needs to be held for at least ten seconds. Increasing the range of motion creates good posture and develops proficient performance in everyday activities increasing the length of life and overall health of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Barratt (1964), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic===
[[Dynamic stretching|Dynamic flexibility]]  is classified as the ability to complete a full range of motion of a joint. This is a release of energy with proper timing for the muscles to contract.&lt;ref name="Holt"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Flexibility : a concise guide to conditioning, performance enhancement, injury prevention, and rehabilitation|last=Holt, Laurence E.|date=2008|publisher=Humana Press|others=Pelham, Thomas W., Holt, Jason.|isbn=9781603271059|location=Totowa, N.J.|oclc=501802731}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also controls movement as the speed increases while stretching parts of the body. This form of stretching prepares the body for physical exertion and sports performance. In the past it was the practice to undertake static stretching before exercise. Dynamic stretching increases range of movement, blood and oxygen flow to soft tissues prior to exertion. Increasingly, coaches and sports trainers are aware of the role in dynamic stretching in improving performance and reducing the risk of injury.

===Static-active===
[[File:Caroline Zhang Spiral 2008 Skate Canada.jpg|thumb|upright|Figure skater [[Caroline Zhang]] at 2008 [[Skate Canada International|Skate Canada]]]]

[[Static stretching|Static]]-[[active stretching]] includes holding an extended position with just the strength of the muscles such as holding the leg in front, side or behind. Static-active flexibility requires a great deal of strength, making it the hardest to develop.

===Ballistic===
[[Ballistic stretching]] is separate from all other forms of stretching. It does not include stretching, but rather a bouncing motion. The actual performance of ballistic movements prevents lengthening of tissues. These movements should only be performed when the body is very warm; otherwise they can lead to injury.

==Limits==
Each individual is born with a particular range of motion for each joint in their body. In the 1964 book ''Finding Balance'' by Gigi Berardi, the author mentions three limiting factors: occupational demands, movement demands, and training oversights.&lt;ref&gt;Berardi (1964), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal factors===
[[File:Urdhva padmasana.jpg|thumb|upright|Male [[yoga]] practitioner in an inverted [[lotus position]]]]
Movement demands include strength, endurance and range of motion. Training oversights occurs when the body is overused.&lt;ref&gt;Berardi (1964), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Internally, the joints, muscles, tendons, and ligaments can affect one's flexibility. As previously mentioned, each part of the body has its own limitations and combined, the range of motion can be affected. The mental attitude of the performer during the state of motion can also affect their range.

===External factors===
Externally, anything from the weather outside to the age of the performer can affect flexibility. General tissues and collagen change with age influencing the individual.{{explain|date=July 2016}}As one ages, performing activities of daily living without pain becomes much harder. By stretching often, one can maintain a level of musculoskeletal fitness that will keep them feeling well.

&lt;ref name="Holt"/&gt; performers should be aware of over-stretching. Even basic things such as clothing and equipment can affect a performance. Dance surfaces and lack of proper shoes can also affect a performer's ability to perform at his/her best.&lt;ref name="Finding Balance"&gt;Berardi (1964), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Signs of injury===
Stretching for too long or too much can give way to an injury.&lt;ref&gt;Blakey (1994), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; For most activities, the normal range of motion is more than adequate. Any sudden movements or going too fast can cause a muscle to tighten. This leads to extreme pain and the performer should let the muscle relax by resting.

==Risk of injury==

Some people get injuries while doing yoga&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Broad |first=William J. |authorlink=William Broad |title=The Science of Yoga: The Risks and the Rewards |url=https://archive.org/details/scienceofyogaris0000broa |url-access=registration |year=2012 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1-4516-4142-4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[aerobics]] {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} so one needs to be careful while doing it. While most stretching does not cause injury, it is said that quick, ballistic stretching can if it is done incorrectly.&lt;ref name="Holt"/&gt; If a bone, muscle or any other part is stretched more than its capacity it may lead to dislocation, muscle pulls, etc. or something even more severe too.

{{short description|Ability of an organism to exert itself and remain active for a long period of time}}

'''Endurance''' (also related to [[wikt:sufferance|sufferance]], [[Resilience (materials science)|resilience]], [[wikt:constitution|constitution]], [[wikt:fortitude|fortitude]], and [[Hardiness (psychological)|hardiness]]) is the ability of an [[organism]] to exert itself and remain active for a long period of time, as well as its ability to resist, withstand, recover from, and have immunity to [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], wounds, or [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]. It is usually used in [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] or [[anaerobic exercise]]. The definition of 'long' varies according to the type of exertion – minutes for high intensity anaerobic exercise, hours or days for low intensity aerobic exercise. Training for endurance can reduce the ability to exert endurance [[physical strength|strength]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Hickson |first =  RC | year = 1980 |title = Interference of strength development by simultaneously training for strength and endurance over a long period |journal = European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology |publisher = Springer Verlag |volume = 45 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 255–63 |doi = 10.1007/BF00421333 |pmid = 7193134}}&lt;!--|access-date = 2007-05-07 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; unless an individual also undertakes [[Strength training|resistance training]] to counteract this effect.

When a person is able to accomplish or withstand a higher amount of effort than their original capabilities their endurance is increasing which to many personnel indicates progress. In looking to improve one's endurance they may slowly increase the amount of [[Strength training#Terminology|repetitions]] or time spent, if higher repetitions are taken rapidly muscle strength improves while less endurance is gained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physical Activity Line: BC's Primary Physical Activity Counseling Service &amp; Your FREE Resource! - Physical Activity Line: BC's Primary Physical Activity Counseling Service &amp; Your FREE Resource!|url=http://physicalactivityline.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=74:muscular-strength-and-endurance&amp;Itemid=69|website=physicalactivityline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing endurance has been proven to release endorphins resulting in a positive mind.

The term '''stamina''' is sometimes used synonymously and interchangeably with endurance.
In military settings, endurance is considered the ability of a force to sustain high levels of combat potential relative to its opponent over the duration of a campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Headquarter, Department of the Army (1994). Leader’s Manual for Combat Stress Control, FM 22-51, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Endurance may also refer to an [[Grit (personality trait)|ability to persevere through a difficult situation]].

== Training ==
Different types of endurance performance can be trained in specified ways. Adaptation of exercise plans should follow individual goals.

Calculating the Intensity of exercise the individual capabilies should be considered. Effective training starts within half the individual performance capability. Performance capability is expressed by [[maximum heart rate]]. Best results can be achieved within 55 up to 65% of maximum heart rate. Aerobic, anaerobic and further thresholds are not to be mentioned within extensive endurance exercises. In general surveillance of training intensity is achieved through measuring the heart rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Tomasits |first=Josef |last2=Haber |first2=Paul |title=Leistungsphysiologie – Grundlagen für Trainer, Physiotherapeuten und Masseure |publisher=Springer-Verlag |year=2008 |isbn=9783211720196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cardiorespiratory fitness''' ('''CRF''') refers to the ability of the [[circulatory system|circulatory]] and [[respiratory system]]s to supply [[oxygen]] to [[skeletal muscle]]s during sustained physical activity. The primary measure of CRF is [[VO2 max|VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Robert|last2=Blair|first2=Steven N.|last3=Arena|first3=Ross|last4=Church|first4=Timothy S.|last5=Després|first5=Jean-Pierre|last6=Franklin|first6=Barry A.|last7=Haskell|first7=William L.|last8=Kaminsky|first8=Leonard A.|last9=Levine|first9=Benjamin D.|date=2016-12-13|title=Importance of Assessing Cardiorespiratory Fitness in Clinical Practice: A Case for Fitness as a Clinical Vital Sign: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association|url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/134/24/e653|journal=Circulation|language=en|volume=134|issue=24|pages=e653–e699|doi=10.1161/CIR.0000000000000461|issn=0009-7322|pmid=27881567|s2cid=3372949}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[American Heart Association]] published an official scientific statement advocating that CRF be categorized as a clinical vital sign and should be routinely assessed as part of clinical practice. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Regular [[exercise]] makes these systems more efficient by enlarging the [[heart]] muscle, enabling more [[blood]] to be pumped with each stroke, and increasing the number of small [[artery|arteries]] in trained skeletal muscles, which supply more blood to working muscles. Exercise improves not just  the respiratory system but the heart by increasing the amount of oxygen that is inhaled and distributed to body tissue.&lt;ref name="1st"&gt;{{cite book|last=Donatello|first=Rebeka J.|title=Health, The Basics|year=2005|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 Cochrane review demonstrated that physical activity interventions are effective for increasing cardiovascular fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hillsdon|first1=M.|last2=Foster|first2=C.|last3=Thorogood|first3=M.|date=2005-01-25|title=Interventions for promoting physical activity|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=1|pages=CD003180|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003180.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmc=4164373|pmid=15674903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many benefits of cardiorespiratory fitness. It can reduce the risk of heart disease, lung cancer, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and other diseases. Cardiorespiratory fitness helps improve lung and heart condition, and increases feelings of wellbeing.&lt;ref name="1st"/&gt; Additionally, there is mounting evidence that CRF is potentially a stronger predictor of mortality than other established risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes. Recently, a new study demonstrated the levels of CRF were associated with early deaths &lt;65 years old among recent generations. Low CRF might be emerging to a new risk factor for early death among US Baby Boomers and Generation Xers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cao|first1=Chao|last2=Yang|first2=Lin|last3=Cade|first3=W. Todd|last4=Racette|first4=Susan B.|last5=Park|first5=Yikyung|last6=Cao|first6=Yin|last7=Friedenreich|first7=Christine M.|last8=Hamer|first8=Mark|last9=Stamatakis|first9=Emmanuel|last10=Smith|first10=Lee|date=2020-01-30|title=Cardiorespiratory Fitness Is Associated with Early Death Among Healthy Young and Middle-aged Baby Boomers and Generation Xers|url=https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(20)30054-1/abstract|journal=The American Journal of Medicine|language=English|volume=0|issue=8|pages=961–968.e3|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2019.12.041|pmid=32006474|issn=0002-9343|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, CRF can be added to these traditional risk factors to improve risk prediction validity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The American College of Sports Medicine recommends aerobic exercise 3–5 times per week for 30–60 minutes per session, at a moderate intensity, that maintains the heart rate between 65–85% of the maximum heart rate.&lt;ref name="2nd"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pollock|first=M.L.|author2=Gaesser, G.A.|title=Acsm position stand: the recommended quantity and quality of exercise for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, and flexibility in healthy adults|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|year=1998|volume=30|issue=6|doi=10.1097/00005768-199806000-00032|pages=975–991|pmid=9624661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cardiovascular system==
The [[cardiovascular system]] responds to changing demands on the body by adjusting cardiac output, [[blood flow]], and [[blood pressure]]. [[Cardiac output]] is defined as the product of [[heart rate]] and [[stroke volume]] which represents the volume of blood being pumped by the heart each minute. Cardiac output increases during physical activity due to an increase in both the heart rate and stroke volume.&lt;ref name="3rd"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=S.P.|author2=Eason, J.M.|author3=Miller, W.C.|title=Exercise Physiology: Basis of Human Movement in Health and Disease|url=https://archive.org/details/exercisephysiolo00brow|url-access=limited|year=2006|pages=[https://archive.org/details/exercisephysiolo00brow/page/n104 75]–247|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0781777308}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of exercise, the cardiovascular adaptations are very rapid: “Within a second after muscular contraction, there is a withdrawal of vagal outflow to the heart, which is followed by an increase in sympathetic stimulation of the heart. This results in an increase in cardiac output to ensure that blood flow to the muscle is matched to the metabolic needs”.&lt;ref name="4th"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors = Howley ET, Powers SK|title=Exercise Physiology: Theory and Application to Fitness and Performance|isbn=978-0078022531|year=1990|publisher=Wm. C. Brown Publishers|location=Dubuque, IA|pages=131–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both heart rate and stroke volume vary directly with the intensity of the exercise performed and many improvements can be made through continuous training.

Another important issue is the regulation of blood flow during exercise. Blood flow must increase in order to provide the working muscle with more oxygenated blood which can be accomplished through neural and [[chemical regulation]]. Blood vessels are under sympathetic tone; therefore, the release of noradrenaline and adrenaline will cause vasoconstriction of non-essential tissues such as the [[liver]], [[intestines]], and [[kidneys]], and decrease neurotransmitter release to the active muscles promoting [[vasodilatation]]. Also, chemical factors such as a decrease in oxygen concentration and an increase in [[carbon dioxide]] or lactic acid concentration in the blood promote vasodilatation to increase blood flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaver|first=L.G.|title=Essentials of Exercise Physiology|isbn=978-0024096210|year=1981|publisher=Burgess Publishing Company|location=minneapolis, MN|pages=1–132}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of increased vascular resistance, blood pressure rises throughout exercise and stimulates [[baroreceptors]] in the carotid arteries and aortic arch. “These pressure receptors are important since they regulate arterial blood pressure around an elevated systemic pressure during exercise”.&lt;ref name="4th"/&gt;

==Respiratory system adaptations==
{{Main article|Respiratory adaptation}}Although all of the described adaptations in the body to maintain [[homeostatic]] balance during exercise are very important, the most essential factor is the involvement of the [[respiratory system]]. The respiratory system allows for the proper exchange and transport of gases to and from the lungs while being able to control the ventilation rate through neural and chemical impulses. In addition, the body is able to efficiently use the three energy systems which include the [[phosphagen]] system, the [[glycolytic]] system, and the [[oxidative]] system.&lt;ref name="3rd"/&gt;

==Temperature regulation==
In most cases, as the body is exposed to physical activity, the core temperature of the body tends to rise as heat gain becomes larger than the amount of heat lost. “The factors that contribute to heat gain during exercise include anything that stimulate metabolic rate, anything from the external environment that causes heat gain, and the ability of the body to dissipate heat under any given set of circumstances”.&lt;ref name="3rd"/&gt; In response to an increase in core temperature, there are a variety of factors which adapt in order to help restore heat balance. The main physiological response to an increase in body temperature is mediated by the thermal regulatory center located in the [[hypothalamus]] of the brain which connects to thermal [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] and [[effector (biology)|effector]]s. There are numerous thermal effectors including [[sweat glands]], [[smooth muscles]] of blood vessels, some [[endocrine glands]], and [[skeletal muscle]]. With an increase in the core temperature, the thermal regulatory center will stimulate the arterioles supplying blood to the skin to dilate along with the release of sweat on the skin surface to reduce temperature through evaporation.&lt;ref name="3rd"/&gt; In addition to the involuntary regulation of temperature, the hypothalamus is able to communicate with the cerebral cortex to initiate voluntary control such as removing clothing or drinking cold water. With all regulations taken into account, the body is able to maintain core temperature within about two or three degrees Celsius during exercise.&lt;ref name="4th"/&gt;

'''Balance''' in [[biomechanics]], is an ability to maintain the line of gravity (vertical line from [[centre of mass]]) of a body within the base of support with minimal postural sway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Shumway-Cook A, Anson D, Haller S |title=Postural sway biofeedback: its effect on reestablishing stance stability in hemiplegic patients|journal=Arch. Phys. Med. Rehabil.|year= 1988|volume= 69|pages= 395–400|pmid=3377664|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sway is the horizontal movement of the centre of gravity even when a person is standing still. A certain amount of sway is essential and inevitable due to small perturbations within the body (e.g., breathing, shifting body weight from one foot to the other or from forefoot to rearfoot) or from external triggers (e.g., visual distortions, floor translations). An increase in sway is not necessarily an indicator of dysfunctional balance so much as it is an indicator of decreased sensorimotor control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davidson|author2=Madigan, Nussbaum|title=Effects of lumbar extensor fatigue and fatigue rate on postural sway|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|year=2004|issue=92|pages=183–189|pmid=15549370|doi=10.1007/s00421-004-1195-1|volume=93|s2cid=10343160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maintaining balance==
Maintaining balance requires coordination of input from multiple sensory systems including the [[vestibular system|vestibular]], [[somatosensory system|somatosensory]], and [[visual system]]s.&lt;ref name="Gribble2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gribble|author2=Hertel|title=Effect of Lower-Extremity Fatigue on Postural Control|journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation|year=2004|issue=4|pages=589–592|pmid=15083434|volume=85|doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2003.06.031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Vestibular system: sense organs that regulate equilibrium ([[equilibrioception]]); directional information as it relates to head position (internal gravitational, linear, and angular acceleration)
* Somatosensory system: senses of [[proprioception]] and [[kinesthesia]] of joints; information from skin and joints (pressure and vibratory senses); spatial position and movement relative to the support surface; movement and position of different body parts relative to each other
* Visual system: Reference to verticality of body and head motion; spatial location relative to objects

The senses must detect changes of spatial orientation with respect to the base of support, regardless of whether the body moves or the base is altered. There are environmental factors that can affect balance such as light conditions, floor surface changes, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[drugs]], and [[ear infection]].

==Balance impairments==
There are balance impairments associated with aging. Age-related decline in the ability of the above systems to receive and integrate [[Sense|sensory]] information contributes to poor balance in [[older adults]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schmitz, T. J. |year=2007|chapter= Examination of Sensory Function|editor= S. B. O'Sullivan |editor2=T.J. Schmitz |title=Physical Rehabilitation|edition=5th |pages=121–157|location=Philadelphia, PA|publisher= F. A. Davis Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the elderly are at an increased risk of [[Falling (accident)|falls]]. In fact, one in three adults aged 65 and over will fall each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |authors= National Center for Injury Prevention and Control|date=8 December 2010|title=Costs of Falls Among Older Adults|access-date= 15 May 2011|url= https://www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/Falls/fallcost.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of an individual standing quietly upright, the limit of stability is defined as the amount of postural sway at which balance is lost and corrective action is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7644574|year=1995|last1=Nichols|first1=DS|last2=Glenn|first2=TM|last3=Hutchinson|first3=KJ|s2cid=2819911|title=Changes in the mean center of balance during balance testing in young adults|volume=75|issue=8|pages=699–706|journal=Physical Therapy|doi=10.1093/ptj/75.8.699}} [http://www.ptjournal.org/cgi/reprint/75/8/699.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;
	  
Body sway can occur in all planes of motion, which make it an increasingly difficult ability to rehabilitate. There is strong evidence in research showing that deficits in postural balance is related to the control of medial-lateral stability and an increased risk of falling. To remain balanced, a person standing must be able to keep the vertical projection of their center of mass within their base of support, resulting in little medial-lateral or anterior-posterior sway. Ankle sprains are one of the most frequently occurring injuries among athletes and physically active people.  The most common residual disability post ankle sprain is instability along with body sway. Mechanical instability includes insufficient stabilizing structures and mobility that exceed physiological limits. Functional instability involves recurrent sprains or a feeling of giving way of the ankle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kilbreath SL, Raymond J, Refshauge KM | year = 2000 | title = The effect of recurrent ankle inversion sprain and taping on proprioception at the ankle | journal = Med Sci Sports Exerc | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 10–5 | doi=10.1097/00005768-200001000-00003| pmid = 10647523 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 40% of patients with ankle sprains suffer from instability and an increase in body sway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guskiewicz KM, Perrin DH | year = 1996 | title = Effect of orthotics on postural sway following inversion ankle sprain. | journal = Journal of Orthopedic and Sports Physical Therapy | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 326–331 | doi=10.2519/jospt.1996.23.5.326| pmid = 8728531 | title-link = ankle sprain | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Injury to the ankle causes a proprioceptive deficit and impaired postural control.  Individuals with muscular weakness, occult instability, and decreased postural control are more susceptible to ankle injury than those with better postural control.

Balance can be severely affected in individuals with neurological conditions. People who suffer a [[stroke]] or [[spinal cord injury]] for example, can struggle with this ability. Impaired balance is strongly associated with future function and recovery after a stroke, and is the strongest predictor of falls.&lt;ref name="Lubetzki-Vilnai &amp; Kartin. (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lubetzki-Vilnai, A. |author2=Kartin, D.|s2cid=13500994| year=2010| title=The effect of balance training on balance performance in individuals poststroke: a systematic review| journal=Journal of Neurologic Physical Therapy| volume=34 | pages=127–137 | doi=10.1097/NPT.0B013E3181EF764D|pmid=20716987|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another population where balance is severely affected is Parkinson's disease patients. A study done by Nardone and Schieppati (2006) showed that individuals with Parkinson's disease problems in balance have been related to a reduced limit of stability and an impaired production of anticipatory motor strategies and abnormal calibration.

Balance can also be negatively affected in a normal population through fatigue in the musculature surrounding the ankles, knees, and hips.  Studies have found, however, that muscle fatigue around the hips (gluteals and lumbar extensors) and knees have a greater effect on postural stability (sway).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davidson|first=B.S. |author2=Madigan, M.L. |author3=Nussbaum, M.A. |name-list-style=amp |title=Effects of lumbar extensor fatigue and fatigue rate on postural sway|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|year=2004|volume=93|pages=183–189|doi=10.1007/s00421-004-1195-1|pmid=15549370|issue=1–2|s2cid=10343160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that muscle fatigue leads to a decreased ability to contract with the correct amount of force or accuracy.  As a result, proprioception and kinesthetic feedback from joints are altered so that conscious joint awareness may be negatively effected.&lt;ref name="Gribble2004" /&gt;

==Balance training==
[[File:Balancing girl 2009.jpg|left|thumb|Balance]]
[[File:Plank on a pair of medicine balls.jpg|right|thumb|Balance Training]]
Since balance is a key predictor of recovery and is required in so many of our [[activities of daily living]], it is often introduced into treatment plans by [[physiotherapists]] and occupational therapists when dealing with geriatrics, patients with neurological conditions, or others for whom balalnce training has been determined to be beneficial.

Balance training in [[stroke]] patients has been supported in the literature.&lt;ref name="Lubetzki-Vilnai &amp; Kartin. (2010)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hammer et al. (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Hammer, A. |author2=Nilsagard, Y. |author3=Wallquist, M. |s2cid=71362704 |name-list-style=amp| year=2008| title=Balance training in stroke patients a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials| journal=Advances in Physiotherapy| volume=10 | pages=163–172| doi=10.1080/14038190701757656|issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods commonly used and proven to be effective for this population include sitting or standing balance practice with various progressions including reaching, variations in base of support, use of tilt boards, gait training varying speed, and stair climbing exercises.&lt;ref name="Lubetzki-Vilnai &amp; Kartin. (2010)"/&gt; Another method to improve balance is perturbation training, which is an external force applied to a person's center of mass in an attempt to move it from the base of support.&lt;ref name="meddic"&gt;Medical Dictionary for the Health Professions and Nursing © Farlex 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The type of training should be determined by a physiotherapist and will depend on the nature and severity of the stroke, stage of recovery, and the patient's abilities and impairments after the stroke.

Populations such as the elderly, children with neuromuscular diseases, and those with motor deficits such as chronic ankle instability have all been studied and balance training has been shown to result in improvements in postural sway and improved “one-legged stance balance” in these groups.&lt;ref name=Gran&gt;{{Cite journal |year=2010|title= Effects of balance training on postural sway, leg extensor strength, and jumping height in adolescents|journal=Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport|volume= 81|issue=3|pages= 245–251|author=Granacher, U. |author2=Gollhofer, A. |author3=Kriemler, S. |name-list-style=amp |doi=10.5641/027013610X13088573595943 |pmid=20949844}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of balance training can be measured by more varied means, but typical quantitative outcomes are [[Center of pressure (terrestrial locomotion)|centre of pressure]] (CoP), postural sway, and static/dynamic balance, which are measured by the subject's ability to maintain a set body position while undergoing some type of instability.&lt;ref name=Gran/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Zech, A., Hübscher, M., Vogt, L., Banzer, W., Hänsel, F., &amp; Pfeifer, K. |year=2010|title= Balance training for neuromuscular control and performance enhancement: A systematic review|journal= Journal of Athletic Training|volume= 45|issue=4|pages=392–403|doi=10.4085/1062-6050-45.4.392|pmid=20617915|pmc=2902034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some types of exercise  (gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks; strengthening exercise; 3D exercise and multiple exercise types) improve clinical balance outcomes in older people, and are seemingly safe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Howe|first1=Tracey E.|last2=Rochester|first2=Lynn|last3=Neil|first3=Fiona|last4=Skelton|first4=Dawn A.|last5=Ballinger|first5=Claire|s2cid=205176433|date=2011-11-09|title=Exercise for improving balance in older people|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=11|pages=CD004963|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004963.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=22071817}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still insufficient evidence supporting general physical activity, computerized balance programs or vibration plates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Functional balance assessments==
Functional tests of balance focus on maintenance of both static and dynamic balance, whether it involves a type of perturbation/change of CoM{{Expand acronym|date=January 2021}} or during quiet stance.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Susan |last1=O'Sullivan|first2=Thomas |last2=Schmitz|title=Physical Rehabilitation|year=2007|publisher=F.A. Davis Company|location=Philadelphia|pages=254–259|edition=Fifth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standardized tests of balance are available to allow allied health care professionals to assess an individual's postural control. Some functional balance tests that are available are:
*'''[[Romberg's test|Romberg Test]]''': used to determine proprioceptive contributions to upright balance. Subject remains in quiet standing while eyes are open. If this test is not difficult enough, there is a Sharpened Romberg's test. Subjects would have to have their arms crossed, feet together and eyes closed. This decreases the base of support, raises the subject's center of mass, and prevents them from using their arms to help balance.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt;
*'''Functional Reach Test''': measures the maximal distance one can reach forward beyond arm's length while maintaining feet planted in a standing position.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt;
*'''[[Berg Balance Scale]]''': measures static and dynamic balance abilities using functional tasks commonly performed in everyday life.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt; One study reports that the Berg Balance Scale is the most commonly used assessment tool throughout [[stroke rehabilitation]], and found it to be a sound measure of balance impairment in patients following a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blum|first=Lisa|author2=Korner-Bitensky, Nicol|title=Usefulness of the Berg Balance Scale in Stroke Rehabilitation: A Systematic Review|journal=Physical Therapy|date=May 2008|volume=88|issue=5|pages=559–566|doi=10.2522/ptj.20070205|pmid=18292215|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA)''': measures both static and dynamic balance using tasks testing balance and [[gait]].&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt;
*'''Timed Up and Go Test''': measures dynamic balance and mobility.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt;
*'''Balance Efficacy Scale''': self-report measure that examines an individual's confidence while performing daily tasks with or without assistance.&lt;ref name="OSullivan"/&gt;
*'''Star Excursion Test''': A dynamic balance test that measures single stance maximal reach in multiple directions.&lt;ref name=Hrys&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hrysomallis, C. |year=2011|title=Balance ability and athletic performance|journal= Sports Medicine|volume= 41|issue=3|pages=221–232|doi=10.2165/11538560-000000000-00000|pmid=21395364|s2cid=24522106|url=http://vuir.vu.edu.au/9079/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The test is used to assess balance impairments and includes 14 items of dynamic balance task, divided in to four subcomponents: anticipatory postural adjustments, reactive postural control, sensory orientation and dynamic gait. Mini-BESTest has been tested for mainly neurological diseases, but also other diseases. A review of psychometric properties of the test support the reliability, validity and responsiveness, and according to the review, it can be considered a standard balance measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Di Carlo|first1=Silvia|last2=Bravini|first2=Elisabetta|last3=Vercelli|first3=Stefano|last4=Massazza|first4=Giuseppe|last5=Ferriero|first5=Giorgio|date=June 2016|title=The Mini-BESTest: a review of psychometric properties|journal=International Journal of Rehabilitation Research|volume=39|issue=2|pages=97–105|doi=10.1097/MRR.0000000000000153|pmid=26795715|s2cid=9649113|issn=0342-5282}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
* '''BESS''': The BESS (Balance Error Scoring System) is a commonly used way to assess balance. It is known as a  simple and affordable way to get an accurate assessment of balance, although the validity of the BESS protocol has been questioned. The BESS is often used in sports settings to assess the effects of mild to moderate head injury on one's postural stability. The BESS tests three separate stances (double leg, single leg, tandem) on two different surfaces (firm surface and medium density foam) for a total of six tests. Each test is 20 seconds long, with the entire time of the assessment approximately 5–7 minutes. The first stance is the double leg stance. The participant is instructed to stand on a firm surface with feet side by side with hands on hips and eyes closed. The second stance is the single leg stance. In this stance the participant is instructed to stand on their non-dominant foot on a firm surface with hands on hips and eyes closed. The third stance is the tandem stance. The participant stands heel to toe on a firm surface with hands on hips and eyes closed. The fourth, fifth, and sixth stances repeat in order stances one, two, and three except the participant performs these stances on a medium density foam surface. The BESS is scored by an examiner who looks for deviations from the proper stances. A deviation is noted when any of the following occurs in the participant during testing: opening the eyes, removing hands from the hips, stumbling forward or falling, lifting the forefoot or heel off the testing surface, abduction or flexion of the hip beyond 30 degrees, or remaining out of the proper testing position for more than 5 seconds.

[[Concussion]] (or mild traumatic brain injury) have been associated with imbalance among sports participants and military personnel. Some of the standard balance tests may be too easy or time-consuming for application to these high-functioning groups, s. Expert recommendations have been gathered concerning balance assessments appropriate to military service-members.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, B. D., Rupert, A. H., &amp; Legan, S. M. (2012).

==Quantitative (computerized) assessments==
Due to recent technological advances, a growing trend in balance assessments has become the monitoring of [[center of pressure (terrestrial locomotion)]] (CoP), the reaction vector of center of mass on the ground, path length for a specified duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hof|year=2005|title=The condition for dynamic stability|journal=Journal of Biomechanics|volume=38|issue=1|pages=1–8|author2=A.L.|author3=Gazendam|author4=M.G.J|author5=Sinke|author6=W.E.|doi=10.1016/j.jbiomech.2004.03.025|pmid=15519333}}&lt;/ref&gt; With quantitative assessments, minimal CoP path length is suggestive of good balance. Laboratory-grade force plates are considered the "gold-standard" of measuring CoP. The NeuroCom Balance Manager (NeuroCom, Clackamas, OR, United States) is a commercially available dynamic [[posturography]] system that uses computerized software to track CoP during different tasks. These different assessments range from the sensory organization test looking at the different systems that contribute through sensory receptor input to the limits of stability test observing a participant's ankle range of motion, velocity, and reaction time. While the NeuroCom is considered the industry standard for balance assessments, it does come at a steep price (about $250,000).

Within the past 5 years research has headed toward inexpensive and portable devices capable of measuring CoP accurately. Recently, Nintendo's Wii balance board (Nintendo, Kyoto, Japan) has been validated against a force plate and found to be an accurate tool to measure CoP &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Clark |year=2010|title=Validity and reliability of the Nintendo Wii balance board for assessment of standing balance|journal= Gait &amp; Posture|volume= 31|issue=3|pages= 307–310|author2=R.|author3=Bryant|author4=A.|author5=Pua|author6=Y.|author7=McCrory|author8=P.|author9=Bennell|doi=10.1016/j.gaitpost.2009.11.012|pmid=20005112}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is very exciting as the price difference in technology ($25 vs $10,000) makes the Wii balance board a suitable alternative for clinicians to use quantitative balance assessments. Other inexpensive, custom-built force plates are being integrated into this new dynamic to create a growing field of research and clinical assessment that will benefit many populations.
[[File:A Bowing in Art 1996.jpg|thumb|Fatigue's effect on balance]]

==Fatigue's effect on balance==
The complexity of balance allows for many confounding variables to affect a person's ability to stay upright. [[Fatigue (medical)]], causing central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, can indirectly result in the inability to remain upright. This is seen repeatedly in clinical populations (e.g. Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis). Another major concern regarding fatigue's effect on balance is in the athletic population. Balance testing has become a standard measure to help diagnose concussions in athletes, but due to the fact that athletes can be extremely fatigued has made it hard for clinicians to accurately determine how long the athletes need to rest before fatigue is gone, and they can measure balance to determine if the athlete is concussed. This can have devastating effects when looking at college and professional games where the athlete is depended upon by a community. So far, researchers have only been able to estimate that athletes need anywhere from 8–20 minutes of rest before testing balance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fox|year=2008|title=Return of postural control to baseline after anaerobic and aerobic exercise protocols|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|volume=43|issue=5|pages=456–63|author2=Z.G.|author3=Mihalik|author4=J.P.|author5=Blakburn|author6=J.T.|author7=Battaglini|author8=C.L.|author9=Guskiewicz|author10=KM|doi=10.4085/1062-6050-43.5.456|pmid=18833307|pmc=2547864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nardone|year=1997|title=Fatigue effects on body balance|journal= Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology/Electromyography and Motor Control|volume=105|issue=4|pages=309–320|author2=A|author3=Tarantola|author4=J|author5=Giordano|author6=A|author7=Schieppati|author8=M|doi=10.1016/S0924-980X(97)00040-4|pmid=9284239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Susco|year=2004|title=Balance recovers within 20 minutes after exertion as measured by the Balance Error Scoring System|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|volume=39|issue=3|pages=241–246|author2=T.M.|author3=McLeod|author4=T.C.V.|author5=Gansneder|author6=B.M.|author7=Shultz|author8=S.J.|pmc=522146|pmid=15496993}}&lt;/ref&gt; That can be a huge difference depending on the circumstances.

==Other factors influencing balance==
Age, gender,{{how|date=August 2014}} and height have all been shown to impact an individual's ability to balance and the assessment{{by whom|date=August 2014}} of that balance.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Typically, older adults have more body sway with all testing conditions.&lt;ref name="Hageman, Leibowitz &amp; Blanke. (1995)"&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hageman, Leibowitz &amp; Blanke| year=1995| title=Age and gender effects on postural control measures| journal=Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation| volume=76 | pages=961–965 | doi=10.1016/S0003-9993(95)80075-1| pmid=7487439|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tests have shown that older adults demonstrate shorter functional reach and larger body sway path lengths. Height also influences body sway in that as height increases, functional reach typically decreases.  However, this test is only a measure of anterior and posterior sway.  This is done to create a repeatable and reliable clinical balance assessment tool.&lt;ref name="Duncan, Pamela W., et al. (1990)"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Duncan, Pamela W.| year=1990| title=Functional reach: a new clinical measure of balance| journal=Journal of Gerontology| volume=45 | pages=192–197 | doi=10.1093/geronj/45.6.M192| pmid=2229941|issue=6|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 Cochrane Review found that specific types of exercise (such as gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks; strengthening exercises; 3D exercises [e.g. Tai Chi] and combinations of these) can help improve balance in older adults. However, there was no or limited evidence on the effectiveness of general physical activities, such as walking and cycling, computer-based balance games and vibration plates.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Voluntary control of balance ==
While balance is mostly an automatic process, voluntary control is common. Active control usually takes place when a person is in a situation where balance is compromised. This can have the counter-intuitive effect of increasing postural sway during basic activities such as standing. One explanation for this effect is that conscious control results in over-correcting an instability and "may inadvertently disrupt relatively automatic control processes."{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} While concentration on an external task "promotes the utilization of more automatic control processes."&lt;ref name="McNevin, N. 2002"/&gt;

==Balance and dual-tasking==
Supra-postural tasks are those activities that rely on postural control while completing another behavioral goal, such as walking or creating a text message while standing upright. Research has demonstrated that postural stability operates to permit the achievement of other activities.&lt;ref name="Stoffregen, T. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Stoffregen T. |author2=Pagulayan R. |author3=Bardy B. |author4=Hettinger L. | year = 2000 | title = Modulating postural control to facilitate visual performance | journal = Human Movement Science | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 203–20 | doi=10.1016/s0167-9457(00)00009-9|citeseerx=10.1.1.467.5141 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, standing in a stable upright position is not at all beneficial if one falls as soon as any task is attempted.  In a healthy individual, it is believed that postural control acts to minimize the amount of effort required (not necessarily to minimize sway), while successfully accomplishing the supra-postural task.&lt;ref name="Stoffregen, T. 2000"/&gt;  Research has shown that spontaneous reductions in postural sway occur in response to the addition of a secondary goal.&lt;ref name="McNevin, N. 2002"&gt;"McNevin, N., Wulf, G. (2002)"{{cite journal|author=McNevin, N. |author2=Wulf, G.| year=2002| title=Attentional focus on supra-postural tasks affects postural control| journal=Human Movement Science| volume=21 |issue=2| pages=187–202| doi=10.1016/s0167-9457(02)00095-7|pmid=12167298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McNevin and Wulf (2002) found an increase in postural performance when directing an individual's attention externally compared to directing attention internally&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McNevin N. |author2=Wulf G. | year = 2002 | title = Attentional focus on supra-postural tasks affects postural control | journal = Human Movement Science | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 187–202 | doi=10.1016/s0167-9457(02)00095-7|pmid=12167298 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, focusing attention on the effects of one's movements rather than on the movement itself will boost performance.  This results from the use of more automatic and reflexive control processes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McNevinEtAl2013" /&gt;  When one is focused on their movements (internal focus), they may inadvertently interfere with these automatic processes, decreasing their performance.  Externally focusing attention improves postural stability, despite increasing postural sway at times.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  It is believed that utilizing automatic control processes by focusing attention externally enhances both performance and learning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  Adopting an external focus of attention subsequently improves the performance of supra-postural tasks, while increasing postural stability.&lt;ref name="McNevinEtAl2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McNevin | first1 = N. | last2 = Weir | first2 = P. | last3 = Quinn | first3 = T. | doi = 10.1080/02701367.2013.762321 | title = Effects of Attentional Focus and Age on Suprapostural Task Performance and Postural Control | journal = Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport | volume = 84 | issue = 1 | pages = 96–103 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23611013| s2cid = 29300584 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Motor coordination''' is the combination of [[List of movements of the human body|body movements]] created with the [[kinematic]] (such as spatial direction) and [[Human kinetics|kinetic]] (force) [[Graphonomics|parameters]] that result in intended  [[motor skill|actions]]. Motor coordination is achieved when subsequent parts of the same movement, or the movements of several [[limb (anatomy)|limbs]] or body parts are combined in a manner that is well timed, smooth, and efficient with respect to the intended goal. This involves the integration of [[proprioception|proprioceptive]] information detailing the position and movement of the musculoskeletal system with the [[Nervous system|neural process]]es in the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]] which control, plan, and relay motor commands. The [[cerebellum]] plays a critical role in this neural control of movement and damage to this part of the brain or its connecting structures and pathways results in impairment of coordination, known as [[ataxia]].

==Properties==

===Nonexact reproduction===
Examples of motor coordination are the ease with which people can stand up, pour water into a glass, walk, and reach for a pen. These are created reliably, proficiently and repeatedly, but these movements rarely are reproduced exactly in their motor details, such as joint angles when pointing&lt;ref name="Domkin 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Domkin | first1 = D. | last2 = Laczko | first2 = J. | last3 = Jaric | first3 = S. | last4 = Johansson | first4 = H. | last5 = Latash | first5 = ML. | title = Structure of joint variability in bimanual pointing tasks | journal = Exp Brain Res | volume = 143 | issue = 1 | pages = 11–23 |date=Mar 2002 | doi = 10.1007/s00221-001-0944-1 | pmid = 11907686 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or standing up from sitting.&lt;ref name="Scholz 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Scholz | first1 = JP. | last2 = Schöner | first2 = G. | title = The uncontrolled manifold concept: identifying control variables for a functional task | journal = Exp Brain Res | volume = 126 | issue = 3 | pages = 289–306 |date=Jun 1999 | doi = 10.1007/s002210050738 | pmid = 10382616 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combination===
The complexity of motor coordination can be seen in the task of picking up a bottle of water and pouring it in a glass. This apparently simple task is actually a combination of complex tasks that are processed at different levels. The levels of processing include: (1) for the prehension movement to the bottle, the reach and hand configuration have to be coordinated, (2) when lifting the bottle, the load and the grip force applied by the fingers need to be coordinated to account for weight, fragility, and slippage of the glass, and (3) when pouring the water from the bottle to the glass, the actions of both arms, one holding the glass and the other that is pouring the water, need to be coordinated with each other. This coordination also involves all of the [[eye–hand coordination]] processes. The brain interprets actions as spatial-temporal patterns and when each hand performs a different action simultaneously,  '''bimanual coordination''' is involved.&lt;ref name = "percep motor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Salter|first=Jennifer E.|author2=Laurie R. Wishart |author3=Timothy D. Lee |author4=Dominic Simon |title=Perceptual and motor contributions to bimanual coordination|journal=Neuroscience Letters|year=2004|volume=363|pages=102–107|doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2004.03.071|pmid=15172094|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional levels of organization are required depending on whether the person will drink from the glass, give it to someone else, or simply put it on a table.&lt;ref name="Weiss 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Weiss | first1 = P. | last2 = Jeannerod | first2 = M. | title = Getting a Grasp on Coordination | journal = News Physiol Sci | volume = 13 | issue =  2| pages = 70–75 |date=Apr 1998 | url = http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/13/2/70.long  | pmid = 11390765 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degrees of freedom problem===
{{Main|Degrees of Freedom Problem (Motor Control)}}
The problem with understanding motor coordination arises from the [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] redundancy caused by the large number of  [[musculoskeletal]] elements  involved. These different elements create  many [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] by which any action can be done because of the range of ways of arranging, turning, extending and combining the various muscles, joints, and limbs in a motor task. Several hypotheses have been developed in explanation of how the nervous system determines a particular solution from a large set of possible solutions that can accomplish the task or [[motor goal]]s equally well.&lt;ref name="Bernstein 1967"&gt;Bernstein N. (1967). The Coordination and Regulation of Movements.  Pergamon Press. New York.{{OCLC|301528509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Muscle synergies===

[[Nikolai Bernstein]] proposed the existence of muscle synergies as a neural strategy of simplifying the control of multiple degrees of freedom.&lt;ref name="Bernstein 1967"/&gt; A functional muscle synergy is defined as a pattern of co-activation of muscles recruited by a single neural command signal.&lt;ref name="Torres-Oviedo 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Torres-Oviedo | first1 = G. | last2 = MacPherson | first2 = JM. | last3 = Ting | first3 = LH. | title = Muscle synergy organization is robust across a variety of postural perturbations | journal = J Neurophysiol | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 1530–46 |date=Sep 2006 | doi = 10.1152/jn.00810.2005 | pmid = 16775203 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One muscle can be part of multiple muscle synergies, and one synergy can activate multiple muscles. The current method of finding muscle synergies is to measure [[Electromyography|EMG]] ([[electromyography]]) signals from the muscles involved in a certain movement so that specific patterns of muscle activation can be identified. Statistical analyses are applied to the filtered EMG data to determine the number of muscle synergies that best represent the original EMG. Alternatively, coherence analysis of EMG data can be used to determine the coupling between muscles and the frequency of common input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boonstra TW, Danna-Dos-Santos A, Xie HB, Roerdink M, Stins JF, Breakspear M | title = Muscle networks: Connectivity analysis of EMG activity during postural control | journal = Sci Rep | volume = 5 | pages = 17830 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.1038/srep17830 | pmid=26634293 | pmc=4669476}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reduced number of control elements (muscle synergies) are combined to form a continuum of muscle activation for smooth motor control during various tasks.&lt;ref name=" d'Avella 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = d'Avella | first1 = A. | last2 = Saltiel | first2 = P. | last3 = Bizzi | first3 = E. | title = Combinations of muscle synergies in the construction of a natural motor behavior | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 300-8|date=Mar 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Ivanenko 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Ivanenko | first1 = Y.P. | last2 = Poppele | first2 = R.E. |author-link3=Francesco Lacquaniti | last3 = Lacquaniti | first3 = F. | title = Five basic muscle activation patterns account for muscle activity during human locomotion | journal = J Physiol | volume = 556 | issue = 1| pages = 267-82|date=Apr 2004 | pmc = 1664897 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These synergies work together to produce movements such as walking or balance control. Directionality of a movement has an effect on how the motor task is performed (i.e. walking forward vs. walking backward, each uses different levels of contraction in different muscles). Researchers have measured EMG signals for [[Perturbation (biology)|perturbation]] applied in multiple directions in order to identify muscle synergies that are present for all directions.&lt;ref name="Torres-Oviedo 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Torres-Oviedo | first1 = G. | last2 = Ting | first2 = LH. | title = Muscle synergies characterizing human postural responses | journal = J Neurophysiol | volume = 98 | issue = 4 | pages = 2144–56 |date=Oct 2007 | doi = 10.1152/jn.01360.2006 | pmid = 17652413 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, it was thought that the muscle synergies eliminated the redundant control of a limited number of [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]  by constraining the movements of certain joints or muscles (flexion and extension synergies). However, whether these muscle synergies are a neural strategy or whether they are the result of kinematic constraints has been debated.&lt;ref name="Tresch 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Tresch | first1 = MC. | last2 = Jarc | first2 = A. | title = The case for and against muscle synergies | journal = Curr Opin Neurobiol | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 601–7 |date=Dec 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.conb.2009.09.002 | pmid = 19828310  | pmc = 2818278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently the term of sensory synergy has been introduced supporting the assumption that synergies are the neural strategies to handle sensory and motor systems.&lt;ref name="Alnajjar 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Alnajjar | first1 = F. | last2 = Itkonen | first2 = M. | last3 = Berenz | first3 = V. | last4 = Tournier | first4 = M. | last5 = Nagai | first5 = C. | last6 = Shimoda | first6 = S. | title = Sensory synergy as environmental input integration. | journal = Frontiers in Neuroscience | volume = 8 | pages = 436 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.3389/fnins.2014.00436 | pmid = 25628523 | pmc = 4292368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uncontrolled manifold hypothesis===

A more recent hypothesis propose that the [[central nervous system]] does not eliminate the redundant [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]], but instead it uses all of them to ensure flexible and stable performance of motor tasks. The [[central nervous system]] makes use of this abundance from the redundant systems instead of restricting them like previously hypothesized. Uncontrolled Manifold (UCM) Hypothesis provides a way to quantify the muscle synergy.&lt;ref name="Latash 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Latash | first1 = ML. | last2 = Anson | first2 = JG. | title = Synergies in health and disease: relations to adaptive changes in motor coordination | journal = Phys Ther | volume = 86 | issue = 8 | pages = 1151–60 |date=Aug 2006 | url = http://ptjournal.apta.org/content/86/8/1151.long | pmid = 16879049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis defines "synergy" a little differently from that stated above; a synergy represents an organization of elemental variables (degrees of freedom) that stabilizes an important performance variable. Elemental variable is the smallest sensible variable that can be used to describe a system of interest at a selected level of analysis, and a performance variable refers to the potentially important variables produced by the system as a whole. For example, in multi-joint reaching task, the angles and the positions of certain joints are the elemental variables, and the performance variables are the endpoint coordinates of the hand.&lt;ref name="Latash 2006"/&gt;

This hypothesis proposes that the controller (the brain) acts in the space of elemental variables (i.e. the rotations shared by the shoulder, elbow, and wrist in arm movements) and selects in the space of manifolds (i.e. sets of angular values corresponding to a final position). This hypothesis acknowledges that variability is always present in human movements, and it categorizes it into two types: (1) bad variability and (2) good variability. Bad variability affects the important performance variable and causes large errors in the final result of a motor task, and a good variability keeps the performance task unchanged and maintains successful outcome. An interesting example of the good variability was observed in the tongue's movements, which are responsible for the speech production.&lt;ref&gt;More precisely, the movements of tongue were modeled by means of a biomechanical tongue model, BTM, controlled by an optimum internal model, which minimizes the length of the path traveled in the internal space during the production of the sequences of tasks (see Blagouchine &amp; Moreau).&lt;/ref&gt; The prescription of the stiffness' level to the tongue's body creates some variability (in terms of the acoustical parameters of speech, such as formants), which is, however, not significant for the quality of speech (at least, in the reasonable range of stiffness' levels).&lt;ref name="iaroslav_02"&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Iaroslav_Blagouchine/publication/224080014_Control_of_a_Speech_Robot_via_an_Optimum_Neural-Network-Based_Internal_Model_With_Constraints Iaroslav Blagouchine and Eric Moreau. ''Control of a Speech Robot via an Optimum Neural-Network-Based Internal Model with Constraints.'' IEEE Transactions on Robotics, vol. 26, no. 1, pp. 142—159, February 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the possible explanations might be that the brain only works to decrease the bad variability that hinders the desired final result, and it does so by increasing the good variability in the redundant domain.&lt;ref name="Latash 2006"/&gt;

==Types==

===Inter-limb ===

Inter-limb coordination concerns how movements are coordinated across limbs. [[J. A. Scott Kelso]] and colleagues have proposed that coordination can be modeled as [[Oscillation#Coupled oscillations|coupled oscillator]]s, a process that can be understood in the [[J. A. Scott Kelso#HKB model|HKB (Haken, Kelso, and Bunz) model]].&lt;ref name="Haken 1985"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Haken | first1 = H. | last2 = Kelso | first2 = JA. | last3 = Bunz | first3 = H. | title = A theoretical model of phase transitions in human hand movements | journal = Biol Cybern | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 347–56 | year = 1985 | doi = 10.1007/BF00336922  | pmid = 3978150 | url = http://www.haskins.yale.edu/Reprints/HL0496.pdf | citeseerx = 10.1.1.170.2683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The coordination of complex inter-limb tasks is highly reliant on the [[Time|temporal]] coordination. An example of such temporal coordination can be observed in the free pointing movement of the eyes, hands, and arms to direct at the same motor target. These coordination signals are sent simultaneously to their effectors. In bimanual tasks (tasks involving two hands), it was found that the functional segments of the two hands are tightly synchronized. One of the postulated theories for this functionality is the existence of a higher, "coordinating schema" that calculates the time it needs to perform each individual task and coordinates it using a [[feedback mechanism]]. There are several areas of the brain that are found to contribute to temporal coordination of the limbs needed for bimanual tasks, and these areas include the [[premotor cortex]] (PMC), the [[parietal cortex]], the mesial motor cortices, more specifically the [[supplementary motor area]] (SMA), the cingulate motor cortex (CMC), the [[primary motor cortex]] (M1), and the [[cerebellum]].&lt;ref name="Swinnen 2010"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Swinnen | first1 = SP. | last2 = Vangheluwe | first2 = S. | last3 = Wagemans | first3 = J. | last4 = Coxon | first4 = JP. | last5 = Goble | first5 = DJ. | last6 = Van Impe | first6 = A. | last7 = Sunaert | first7 = S. | last8 = Peeters | first8 = R. | last9 = Wenderoth | first9 = N. | title = Shared neural resources between left and right interlimb coordination skills: the neural substrate of abstract motor representations | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 2570–80 |date=Feb 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.10.052 | pmid = 19874897  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intra-limb===
Intra-limb coordination involves the planning of trajectories in the [[Cartesian plane]]s.&lt;ref name="Weiss 1998"/&gt; This reduces computational load and the degrees of freedom for a given movement, and it constrains the limbs to act as one unit instead of sets of muscles and joints. This concept is similar to "muscle synergies" and "coordinative structures." An example of such concept is the minimum-jerk model proposed by [[Neville Hogan]] and Tamar Flash,&lt;ref name="Flash 1985"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Flash | first1 = T. | last2 = Hogan | first2 = N. | title = The coordination of arm movements: an experimentally confirmed mathematical model | journal = J Neurosci | volume = 5 | issue = 7 | pages = 1688–703 |date=Jul 1985 | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/content/5/7/1688.long | pmid = 4020415 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.05-07-01688.1985 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; which predicts that the parameter that the nervous system controls is the spatial path of the hand, i.e. the end-effector (which implies that the movement is planned in the Cartesian coordinates) and that the movement along the path is maximally smooth. Other early studies showed that the end-effector follows a regularized kinematic pattern.&lt;ref name=" Abend 1982"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Abend | first1 = W. | last2 = Bizzi | first2 = E. | last3 = Morasso | first3 = P. | title = Human arm trajectory formation | journal = Brain | volume = 105 | issue = 2| pages = 331-48|date=Jun 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[Francesco Lacquaniti]], Carlo Terzuolo and Paolo Viviani showed that the angular velocity of the pen’s tip varies with the two-thirds power of the path curvature (two-thirds [[power law]]) during drawing and handwriting.&lt;ref name="lacquaniti"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lacquaniti, Francesco |author2=Terzuolo, Carlo |author3=Viviani, Paolo|title = The law relating the kinematic and figural aspects of drawing movements|journal = Acta Psychologica|year = 1983|volume = 54|issue = 1–3|pages=115–130|doi=10.1016/0001-6918(83)90027-6|pmid=6666647}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two-thirds power law is compatible with the minimum-jerk model, but it is also compatible with sinusoidal pattern generators, such as those of [[central pattern generators]]. It has subsequently been shown that the central nervous system is devoted to its coding.&lt;ref name=" Schwartz 1994"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Schwartz | first1 = A.B. | title = Direct cortical representation of drawing | journal = Science | volume = 265 | issue = 5171| pages = 540-2|date=Jul 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dayan 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Dayan | first1 = E. | last2 = Casile | first2 = A. | last3 = Levit-Binnun | first3 = N. | last4 = Giese | first4 = MA. | last5 = Hendler | first5 = T. | last6 = Flash | first6 = T. | title = Neural representations of kinematic laws of motion: evidence for action-perception coupling | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 104 | issue = 51 | pages = 20582–7 |date=Dec 2007 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0710033104 | pmid = 18079289 | pmc = 2154474 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The joint-space model postulates that the motor system plans movements in joint coordinates.&lt;ref name=" Soechting 1981"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Soechting | first1 = J.F. | last2 =Lacquaniti |first2 =F. |title = Invariant characteristics of a pointing movement in man | journal = J Neurosci |year = 1981|volume = 1|issue = 7 |pages=710-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this model, the controlled parameter is the position of each joint contributing to the movement. Control strategies for goal directed movement differ according to the task that the subject is assigned. This was proven by testing two different conditions: (1) subjects moved cursor in the hand to the target and (2) subjects move their free hand to the target. Each condition showed different trajectories: (1) straight path and (2) curved path.&lt;ref name="Li 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Li | first1 = Y. | last2 = Levin | first2 = O. | last3 = Forner-Cordero | first3 = A. | last4 = Swinnen | first4 = SP. | title = Interactions between interlimb and intralimb coordination during the performance of bimanual multijoint movements | journal = Exp Brain Res | volume = 163 | issue = 4 | pages = 515–26 |date=Jun 2005 | doi = 10.1007/s00221-004-2206-5 | pmid = 15657696 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye–hand===
{{main|Eye–hand coordination}}
[[Eye–hand coordination]]  concerns how eye movements are coordinated with and affect hand movements. Typical findings relate to the eye looking at an object before the hand starts moving towards that object.&lt;ref name="Liesker 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Liesker | first1 = H. | last2 = Brenner | first2 = E. | last3 = Smeets | first3 = JB. | title = Combining eye and hand in search is suboptimal | journal = Exp Brain Res | volume = 197 | issue = 4 | pages = 395–401 |date=Aug 2009 | doi = 10.1007/s00221-009-1928-9 | pmid = 19590859 | pmc = 2721960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning==
Bernstein proposed that individuals learn coordination first by restricting the degrees of freedom that they use. By controlling only a limited set of degrees of freedom, this enables the learner to simplify the dynamics of the body parts involved and the range of movement options. Once the individual has gained some proficiency, these restrictions can be relaxed so allowing them to use the full potential of their body.&lt;ref name="Bernstein 1967"/&gt;

'''Age-related mobility disability''' is a self-reported inability to walk due to impairments, limited mobility, [[dexterity]] or [[Endurance|stamina]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Ward, Rachel E. et al. “Sensory and Motor Peripheral Nerve Function and Incident Mobility Disability.” Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 62.12 (2014): 2273–2279. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found mostly in older adults with decreased strength in lower extremities.&lt;ref name="Guralnik, Jack M. 2000"&gt;Guralnik, Jack M., et al. "Lower extremity function and subsequent disability consistency across studies, predictive models, and value of gait speed alone compared with the Short Physical Performance Battery." The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 55.4 (2000): M221-M231.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

According to the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]], the population of older adults is expected to increase in the United States by 2030 due to the aging population of the [[baby boomer]] generation; this will increase the population of mobility [[disabled]] individuals in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Feasley, Jill C., ed. Health outcomes for older people: Questions for the coming decade. National Academies, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This raises the importance of being able to predict disability due to inability to walk at an early stage, which will eventually decrease health care costs. Aging cause a decrease in physical strength and in lower extremities which ultimately leads to decrease in functional mobility,&lt;ref name="Guralnik, Jack M. 2000"/&gt;  in turn leading to disability which is shown to be common in women due to differences in distribution of resources and opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Zunzunegui, M. V., et al. "The mobility gap between older men and women: the embodiment of gender." Archives of gerontology and geriatrics 61.2 (2015): 140-148.&lt;/ref&gt; The early detection of mobility disabilities will help clinicians and patients in determining the early management of the conditions which could be associated with the future disability. Mobility disabilities are not restricted to older and [[hospitalized]] individuals; such disabilities have been reported in young and non-hospitalized individuals as well due to decreased functional mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Iezzoni, Lisa I et al. “Mobility Difficulties Are Not Only a Problem of Old Age.” Journal of General Internal Medicine 16.4 (2001): 235–243. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in the rate of disability causes loss of functional independence &lt;ref&gt;Fried, Linda P., and Jack M. Guralnik. "Disability in older adults: evidence regarding significance, etiology, and risk." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 45.1 (1997): 92-100., Hirvensalo, Mirja, Taina Rantanen, and Eino Heikkinen. "Mobility difficulties and physical activity as predictors of mortality and loss of independence in the community‐living older population." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 48.5 (2000): 493-498.&lt;/ref&gt; and increases the risk of future [[chronic diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;Reuben, David B., et al. "Value of functional status as a predictor of mortality: results of a prospective study." The American journal of medicine 93.6 (1992): 663-669., Manton, Kenneth G. "A longitudinal study of functional change and mortality in the United States." Journal of Gerontology 43.5 (1988): S153-S161., Khokhar, Shafiq R., et al. "Persistent mobility deficit in the absence of deficits in activities of daily living: a risk factor for mortality." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 49.11 (2001): 1539-1543.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- As we have come across the importance of early detection of disability due to inability to walk, the question arises, in which conditions a person has decreased functional mobility or is disabled.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} --&gt;

==Definition==

There are many definitions that contribute in providing the meaning of mobility disability, it is stated as the “self-reports of a lot of difficulties or inability to walk a quarter section|quarter of a mile” &lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; without sitting and within time limit of fifteen minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, Linda P., and Jack M. Guralnik. "Disability in older adults: evidence regarding significance, etiology, and risk." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 45.1 (1997): 92-100., Gill, Thomas M., et al. "The dynamic nature of mobility disability in older persons." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 54.2 (2006): 248-254., Vestergaard, Sonja et al. “Stopping to Rest during a 400-Meter Walk and Incident Mobility Disability in Older Persons with Functional Limitations.” Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 57.2 (2009): 260–265. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017., Marsh, Anthony P. et al. “Muscle Strength and BMI as Predictors of Major Mobility Disability in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders Pilot (LIFE-P).” The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 66A.12 (2011): 1376–1383. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to walk within this time frame results in the use of [[mobility aid]] devices such as [[mobility scooter]], [[wheelchair]], [[crutches]] or a [[walker (mobility)|walker]] which will eventually help in the community [[ambulation]]. Another term that is coined to define mobility disabilities based on performance is “performance based mobility disability”.&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Noreen et al. “Performance-Based Measures of Physical Function as Mortality Predictors: Incremental Value beyond Self-Reports.” Demographic research 30.7 (2014): 227–252. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the inability to increase your walking speed more than 0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;Tinetti, Mary E., et al. "Shared risk factors for falls, incontinence, and functional dependence: unifying the approach to geriatric syndromes." Jama 273.17 (1995): 1348-1353., Rantanen, Taina, et al. "Coimpairments: strength and balance as predictors of severe walking disability." The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 54.4 (1999): M172-M176., Melzer, David et al. “The Apolipoprotein E e4 Polymorphism Is Strongly Associated With Poor Mobility Performance Test Results But Not Self-Reported Limitation in Older People.” The Journals of Gerontology. Series A, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 60.10 (2005): 1319–1323. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; If an individual is unable to walk at &gt;0.4&amp;nbsp;m/s, he or she is considered severely disabled and would require a [[mobility device]] to walk in community.

==Risk factors==

There are number of factors that could be associated with [[mobility disability]], but according to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], “[[stroke]] is found to be the leading cause of [[mobility disability]], in turn reducing functional mobility in more than half of the [[stroke]] survivors above 65 years of age”.&lt;ref&gt;Mozaffarian, Dariush, et al. "Executive summary: Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics-2016 update: A report from the American Heart Association." Circulation 133.4 (2016): 447.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures==

There are several measurement scales designed to detect mobility disabilities. The measures that can detect mobility disabilities are classified into two categories, [[self-reported]] measures and performance measures. There is a need to differentiate between these measures based on their ability to detect mobility disabilities, such as differences in their reliability and [[Validity (logic)|validity]]. Self-reported measures are commonly used to detect mobility disabilities,&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Walter H., et al. "Self‐Reported Causes of Physical Disability in Older People: The Cardiovascular Health Study." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 42.10 (1994): 1035-1044., Odding, E et al. “Association of Locomotor Complaints and Disability in the Rotterdam Study.” Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases 54.9 (1995): 721–725. Print., Leveille, Suzanne G, Linda Fried, and Jack M Guralnik. “Disabling Symptoms: What Do Older Women Report?” Journal of General Internal Medicine 17.10 (2002): 766–773. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017., Keenan, Anne‐maree, et al. "Impact of multiple joint problems on daily living tasks in people in the community over age fifty‐five." Arthritis Care &amp; Research 55.5 (2006): 757-764., Mottram, Sara, et al. "Patterns of pain and mobility limitation in older people: cross-sectional findings from a population survey of 18,497 adults aged 50 years and over." Quality of Life Research 17.4 (2008): 529-539.&lt;/ref&gt; but recently developed performance measures have been shown to be effective in predicting future mobility disabilities in older adults.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Thomas M., et al. "The dynamic nature of mobility disability in older persons." Journal of the American Geriatrics Society 54.2 (2006): 248-254.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-reported measures===

Several [[qualitative research]] studies use [[survey (human research)]], [[questionnaires]] and [[self-reported]] scales to detect a decrease in functional mobility or to predict future [[mobility disability]] in older adults.&lt;ref&gt;Pruitt, Leslie A. et al. “Use of Accelerometry to Measure Physical Activity in Older Adults at Risk for Mobility Disability.” Journal of aging and physical activity 16.4 (2008): 416–434. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages of these [[qualitative research]] scales are easier [[data acquisition]] and can be performed on the larger population. Although there is difference in [[perception]] of condition between subjects (gender difference), type of [[chronic conditions]] and age-related changes such as memory and reasoning, all of which can affect the information and scores of the individual, still [[self-reported]] measures have been used extensively in behavioral and [[correlation]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;Baranowski, Tom. "Validity and reliability of self-report measures of physical activity: an information-processing perspective." Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport 59.4 (1988): 314-327.&lt;/ref&gt; The commonly used [[self-reported]] measures to detect [[mobility disability]] are [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=934 Stroke Impact scale], [https://www.radc.rush.edu/docs/var/detail.htm;jsessionid=B3230195781CD0E8FB1AD4FBA904F317?category=Disabilities&amp;variable=rosbsum Rosow- Breslau scale], [[Barthel index]], [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/PrintView.aspx?ID=899 Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale]. 
Based on reliability and validity of these scales, [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=934 Stroke Impact scale] has proven to have excellent [[test-retest reliability]] and [[construct validity]], however, if it can predict future mobility disability in older adults is yet to be found. In contrast, [https://www.radc.rush.edu/docs/var/detail.htm;jsessionid=B3230195781CD0E8FB1AD4FBA904F317?category=Disabilities&amp;variable=rosbsum Rosow- Breslau scale], [[Barthel Index]] and [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/PrintView.aspx?ID=899 Tinetti Falls Efficacy Scale] proved important to predict future [[mobility disability]] based on the activities involved in these [[questionnaire]] scales.

===Performance-based measures===

Mobility disabilities due to age-related [[musculoskeletal]] pain or increase in [[chronic condition|chronic]] conditions are easier to detect by performance measures.  Some commonly used performance measures to detect mobility disabilities are the 400-meter walking test, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.1790010108/pdf 5-minute walk test ], [[walking speed]],  [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test]. 
Among these measures, [https://web.archive.org/web/20170427100145/http://www.bu.edu/bostonroc/performance-based-measures-pbm-core/400-meter-walk/ 400-meter walk test] and [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test] has been proven to be strong predictors of [[mobility disability]] in older adults. In addition to prediction, there is moderate to excellent [[correlation]] between these two tests.&lt;ref&gt;Vasunilashorn, Sarinnapha et al. “Use of the Short Physical Performance Battery Score to Predict Loss of Ability to Walk 400 Meters: Analysis From the InCHIANTI Study.” The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences 64A.2 (2009): 223–229. PMC. Web. 26 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Based on reliability and validity of measurement scales to predict [[mobility disability]], [[self-reported]] measures such as [[Barthel index]], and [[performance]] measures such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20170427100145/http://www.bu.edu/bostonroc/performance-based-measures-pbm-core/400-meter-walk/ 400 m walk test] and  [http://www.rehabmeasures.org/Lists/RehabMeasures/DispForm.aspx?ID=1104 short physical performance battery test] are strongly associated with prediction of mobility disability in older adults.

[[File:Matten13.jpg|thumb|300px|Material to exercise the balance agility for children]]
'''Agility''' or '''nimbleness''' is an ability to change the body's [[list of human positions|position]] efficiently, and requires the integration of isolated movement skills using a combination of [[balance (ability)|balance]], [[coordination (physiology)|coordination]], [[speed]], [[reflexes]], [[physical strength|strength]] and [[endurance]]. Agility is the ability to change the direction of the body in an efficient and effective manner and to achieve this requires a combination of
* Balance – The ability to maintain equilibrium when stationary or moving (i.e. not to fall over) through the coordinated actions of our sensory functions (eyes, ears and the proprioceptive organs in our joints);
* Static balance – The ability to retain the centre of mass above the base of support in a stationary position;
* Dynamic balance – The ability to maintain balance with body movement;
* Speed - The ability to move all or part of the body quickly;
* Strength - The ability of a muscle or muscle group to overcome a resistance; and lastly,
* Coordination – The ability to control the movement of the body in co-operation with the body's sensory functions (e.g., in catching a ball [ball, hand, and eye coordination]).

In sports, agility is often defined in terms of an individual sport, due to it being an integration of many components each used differently (specific to all of sorts of different sports). Sheppard and Young (2006) defined agility as a "rapid whole body movement with change of velocity or direction in response to a stimulus".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Agility literature review: classifications, training and testing |author1=J.

Agility is also an important attribute in many [[role playing games]], both video games such as [[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]], and tabletop games such as ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]''. Agility may affect the character's ability to evade an enemy's attack or land their own, or pickpocket and pick locks.

In modern-day psychology, author, psychologist, and executive coach Susan David introduces a concept that she terms “emotional agility,” defined as: “being flexible with your thoughts and feelings so that you can respond optimally to everyday situations.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/well/family/teaching-your-child-emotional-agility.html|title=Teaching Your Child Emotional Agility|last=Dell’Antonia|first=K.

The concept has also been applied to higher education management and leadership, where it was used to accelerate slower traditional and deliberative processes and to replace them with corporate decision making.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Utz, "Against Adminspeak," [https://www.chronicle.com/article/Against-Adminspeak/249047?key=hsZMErKIgGC276GPIxqHkSP5jbKbjZo7inN_XME_7x91_awBNokn0OtP-fqf8M6Ic0s4X016U01jTmlpaGVtSElwWjVONE9iRjI5UW9BdldZNVlTVEotMUVyVQ Chronicle of Higher Education], June 24, 2020.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology misconception ==
"[[Exercise]]" and "physical activity" are frequently used interchangeably and generally refer to physical activity performed during leisure time with the primary purpose of improving or maintaining physical fitness, physical performance, or health. Physical activity is not exactly the ''same'' concept as exercise. Exercise is defined as a subcategory of physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive, and purposeful in the sense that the improvement or maintenance of one or more components of physical fitness is the objective.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Conversely, physical activity includes exercise but may also be unplanned, unstructured, random and non-purposeful carried out for a multitude of reasons.  
[[File:Intensity and Energy Expenditure.png|thumb|460x460px|Intensity of physical activities on a continuum from sedentary behavior to vigorous physical activity. ]]

== Intensity ==
Physical activity can be at any intensity, from a simple twitch of a muscle, to an all out sprint. For practicality, physical activity can be viewed as a continuum from sedentary behavior to vigorous intensity activity.  Intensities are broadly categorized according to [[energy expenditure]] using a standard measure of intensity, [[Metabolic equivalent|metabolic equivalents]] (METs). The broad categories are sedentary behavior, light activity, moderate activity and vigorous activity.  

=== Example activities at each intensity ===
The example activities presented below are just that, examples. Depending on the individual and the activity involved, activities may overlap intensity categories or change categories completely.

Physical activity has been shown to reduce anxiety as a condition (individual physical exercise, without continuity), anxiety as a personality trait (continuous performance, "exercise" of certain physical activities), psycho-physiological signs of anxiety - blood pressure and heart rate (moderate physical activity can lead to a decrease in the intensity of short-term physiological reactivity and encourage recovery from short-term physiological stressors (Biddle &amp; et al., 2000)). 

For people with a severe depressive episode and anxiety disorder, long and short walks proved to be the most effective, and for people with substance abuse disorders, bipolar disorder and frequent psychotic decompensation, "strenuous" gymnastics and riding proved to be the most effective.{{Medical citation needed|date=February 2021}}

== Recommendations for physical activity (including sleep and sedentary behavior) ==

=== Global recommendations ===
The World Health Organization recommend the following:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Adults aged 18–64 ====
{{multiple image |
|width1 = 160 |image1 = Soldier running in water.jpg |caption1 = [[Running]] in water
|width2 = 187 |image2 = MARIANA DE MELO.JPG |caption2 = [[Weight training]] }}
1. Adults aged 18–64 should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or do at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity. 

2. Aerobic activity should be performed in bouts of at least 10 minutes duration. 

3. For additional health benefits, adults should increase their moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity to 300 minutes per week, or engage in 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity. 

4. Muscle-strengthening activities should be done involving major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week.

==== Adults aged 65+ ====
1. Adults aged 65 years and above should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or do at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity. 

2. Aerobic activity should be performed in bouts of at least 10 minutes duration. 

3. For additional health benefits, adults aged 65 years and above should increase their moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity to 300 minutes per week, or engage in 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, or an equivalent combination of moderate-and vigorous-intensity activity. 

4. Adults of this age group, with poor mobility, should perform physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls on 3 or more days per week. 

5. Muscle-strengthening activities should be done involving major muscle groups, on 2 or more days a week. 

6. When adults of this age group cannot do the recommended amounts of physical activity due to health conditions, they should be as physically active as their abilities and conditions allow.

==== Children and Adolescents aged 5–17 ====
1. Children and youth aged 5–17 should accumulate at least 60 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity daily. 

2. Amounts of physical activity greater than 60 minutes provide additional health benefits. 

3. Most of the daily physical activity should be aerobic. Vigorous-intensity activities should be incorporated, including those that strengthen muscle and bone, at least 3 times per week.

=== Country-level recommendations ===

Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-phys-act-guidelines|title=Australia's Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines|website=The Department of Health Australia|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/preventative-health-wellness/physical-activity|title=Physical Activity|website=Ministry of Health|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-physical-activity-guidelines|title=UK physical activity guidelines|website=Department of Health and Social Care|access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans 2nd Edition|url=https://health.gov/our-work/physical-activity/current-guidelines|access-date=2020-12-04|website=Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion}}&lt;/ref&gt; are among the countries that have issued physical activity recommendations.

===Predictors of physical activity levels===
The amount of physical activity conducted by a population, and by extension the proportion of that population reaching guidelines or other specified thresholds, is dictated by a number of factors including demographics (e.g. age, sex, ethnicity), population health status, cultural aspects, and the state of the environment itself (e.g. infrastructure that affords physical activity).

Studies have shown that as availability of natural environments (e.g. parks, woodlands, inland waters, coasts) increases, more leisure-time physical activity such as walking and cycling are reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=53–60 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.06.038|pmid=26151390| title = Energy expenditure on recreational visits to different natural environments |year = 2015| last1=Elliott| first1=Lewis| last2=White| first2=Mathew| last3=Taylor| first3=Adrian| last4=Herbert| first4=Stephen|journal=Social Science and Medicine|volume=139| doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meteorological conditions have been found to predict physical activity differently in different types of environment. For example, in a large population-based study in England, higher air temperatures and lower wind speeds were associated with increased physical activity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=39–50 |doi=10.1016/j.ufug.2019.05.005|title= The effects of meteorological conditions and daylight on nature-based recreational physical activity in England |year=2019 |last1=Elliott |first1=Lewis |last2=White |first2=Mathew |last3=Sarran| first3=Christopher|last4=Grellier| first4=James |last5=Garrett |first5=Jo|last6=Scoccimarro|first6=Enrico|last7=Smalley |first7=Alexander|last8=Fleming|first8=Lora|journal=Urban Forestry &amp; Urban Greening|volume=42|url=https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/10871/37275/1/Elliott%20-%202019%20-%20The%20effects%20of%20meteorological%20conditions%20and%20dayli.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, in 2016, according to a pooled analysis of 298 population-based surveys, around 81% of students aged 11–17 years were insufficiently physically active.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Guthold|first1=Regina|last2=Stevens|first2=Gretchen A.|last3=Riley|first3=Leanne M.|last4=Bull|first4=Fiona C.|date=2019-11-21|title=Global trends in insufficient physical activity among adolescents: a pooled analysis of 298 population-based surveys with 1·6 million participants|url=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanchi/article/PIIS2352-4642(19)30323-2/abstract|journal=The Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health|language=en|volume=0|issue=1|pages=23–35|doi=10.1016/S2352-4642(19)30323-2|pmid=31761562|pmc=6919336|issn=2352-4642}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region with the highest prevalence of insufficient activity in 2016 was high-income Asia Pacific.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text bytes="6877" xml:space="preserve">A '''transcontinental walk''' involves crossing a [[continent]] on foot.  If a walk does not technically cross the entire continent, but starts and ends in a major city right near two opposing sides of a continent, it is usually considered transcontinental. People have crossed continents walking alone or in groups.

==Purpose==
Some people have completed a transcontinental walk due to a whim or a bet.  Others have attempted transcontinental expeditions for scientific study or [[exploration]]. Transcontinental marches have been organized to serve as a [[scientific demonstration|demonstration]] to attract interest in some topic, or raise funds for a cause.

==Challenges==
Depending on the continent to be crossed, different challenges arise. To cross [[Antarctica]] on foot, supplying provisions would have to be well-planned.  Crossing any continent on foot is also a test of endurance and physical condition. People who do a crossing without support have to transport equipment, tent, food etc., on a carriage or sled. That is an extra challenge, compared to those who have car support.

Group transcontinental walks can be tougher to organize logistically than solo or duo efforts, especially when crossing international borders, since there generally needs to be greater accommodations and more thorough approvals for a group. There is also a tougher process of decision making with even a small group than with one or two people. People walking in groups sometimes say that the walking part is easier than dealing with group politics and dynamics. One participant in the [[Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament]], a transcontinental group march of about 500 people in 1986, said, “We can’t agree on anything except to knock at the Porta-Potty.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-11-09-vw-24076-story.html|title=Unlikely Saga of Great Peace March Nears Its Climax|author=Kathleen Hendrix|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 9, 1986|accessdate=March 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Fletcher Lummis===
In 1884, [[Charles Fletcher Lummis]] was working for a newspaper in Cincinnati when he was offered a job with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Lummis decided to make the 3,500-mile journey from [[Cincinnati]] to [[Los Angeles]] on foot. He chronicled the 143 days of his journey, sending weekly dispatches to the newspaper. In spite of a broken arm and heavy snows in New Mexico, he finished the trip, and in 1892, his writings of the journey were published as a book, ''A Tramp Across the Continent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/tramp-across-america|title=A Tramp Across America|author=Greg Luther|publisher=Lapham's Quarterly|date=February 19, 2018|accessdate=March 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Hugh Gillis===
In 1906, on a bet and a dare, [[John Hugh Gillis]] walked from [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia]] to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]].  He was the first person to cross [[Canada]] on foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblio.com/book/transcontinental-pedestrians-canadas-first-cross-country/d/1031525885|title=Transcontinental Pedestrians: Canada's First Cross country Walk|author=George Edward Hart|publisher=FitzHenry and Whiteside|accessdate=March 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament===
In 1986, hundreds of people walked from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Washington DC]] in what is referred to as the [[Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament]].  The march took nine months to traverse {{Convert|3700|mi}}, advancing approximately fifteen miles per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-11-09-vw-24076-story.html|title=Unlikely Saga of Great Peace March Nears Its Climax|date=November 9, 1986|accessdate=March 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A Walk of the People – A Pilgrimage for Life===
A [[Walk of the People – A Pilgrimage for Life]] called for an end to the [[Cold War]] with better relations between the U.S. and former [[Soviet Union]]. Walkers started at [[Point Conception]], Calif., in 1984 and went through Texas and the Deep South to [[New York City]]. A core group of eight flew to [[Dublin]], Ireland, in 1985 and walked to the border of the former [[East Germany]]. They obtained visas to [[Hungary]] and walked to that border before visiting several cities by train. Some walked to [[Geneva]], Switzerland, then organized a trip to [[Moscow]], Russia, by train.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.apnews.com/7ba3f8625c2931f93edb4a112db1c95e|title=U.S. Peace Activists Denied East German Visas - Associated Press|date=September 12, 1985|accessdate=March 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==

Australia has been host to a number of people who have walked across the country, who have completed the walk as either a personal challenge or to raise funds and awareness for charity.

==Antarctica==

===Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition===
The [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] was an attempt from 1914 to 1917, to march across [[Antarctica]], and was the last major expedition of the [[Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/British-Imperial-Trans-Antarctic-Expedition|title=British Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=March 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==

===Trans-Europe Foot Race===
In the [[Trans-Europe Foot Race]], participants cross [[Europe]] on foot, although they are mainly running, not walking. It is a [[multiday race]], and in 2003 crossed about 3,200 miles in Europe from [[Lisbon]] to [[Moscow]]. There were 21 finishers, not counting a wheelchair user. In 2009, it crossed Europe from Bari, Italy, to North Cape, Norway, in 64 days. It had 45 finishers. The participants have support with food, beverages and accommodation. There was also a race in 2012, and another is planned for 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.transcontinental-footrace.com/en/trans-europe-footrace|title=The Trans Europe Footrace - Archives and statistics|author=Ingo Schulze|accessdate=March 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of the '''longest walks''' that have occurred in groups and on solo or duo projects. Many have promoted social causes or medical conditions. Some have been done mostly for the experience.

Groups consist of three or more people who walked at least most of the entire distance. Solo/duo walks are one or two people. The difference is that the former is tougher to organise logistically, especially when crossing international borders, since there generally needs to be greater accommodations and more thorough approvals for a group. There is also a tougher process of decision making with even a small group than with one or two people. Some people walking in groups say that the walking part can be easier than dealing with group politics and dynamics.

The walks should be continuous, save for a few weeks to organise through other countries. There is a separate section for long runs and wheelchair expeditions that were not walks.

== Longest group walks ==
These were walks involving three or more long-distance participants.

Though people often use [[physical activity]] and [[exercise]] interchangeably, the terms have different definitions. “Physical activity” refers to any body movement that burns calories, whether it’s for work or play, daily chores, or the daily commute. “Exercise,” a subcategory of physical activity, refers to -planned, structured, and repetitive- activities aimed at improving physical fitness and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Physical Activity |url=https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-causes/physical-activity-and-obesity/#references |website=Harvard School of Public Health |access-date=18 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exercise]] is a bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall [[health]] and [[Well-being|wellness]]. Physical activity is number one most common health issue in the world. Staying physically active can help prevent or delay certain [[diseases]], including some [[cancers]], [[heart disease]] and [[diabetes]], and also relieve [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and improve mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 10 Most Common Health Issues |url=https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/senior-health/common-issues/top-ten.aspx |website=University of Rochester |access-date=15 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research ''Physical Activity Fundamental to Preventing Disease'' published by U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services claims that virtually all individuals can benefit from regular physical activity, whether they participate in vigorous exercise or some type of moderate health-enhancing physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Physical Activity Fundamental To Preventing Disease |author=Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation |url=https://aspe.hhs.gov/basic-report/physical-activity-fundamental-preventing-disease |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |access-date=15 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immediate benefits ==

=== Brain activity ===

The benefits of physical exercise, especially aerobic exercise, have positive effects on brain function on multiple fronts, ranging from the molecular to behavioral level. According to a study done by the Department of Exercise Science at the University of Georgia, even briefly exercising for 20 minutes facilitates information processing and memory functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tomporowski |first1=Phillip D. |title=Effects of acute bouts of exercise on cognition |journal=Acta Psychologica |date=March 2003 |volume=112 |issue=3 |pages=297–324 |doi=10.1016/s0001-6918(02)00134-8 |pmid=12595152 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12595152 |issn=0001-6918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercise affects the brain on multiple fronts. It increases heart rate, which pumps more oxygen to the brain. It also aids the bodily release of a plethora of hormones, all of which participate in aiding and providing a nourishing environment for the growth of brain cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Physical Exercise for Brain Health |url=https://www.brainhq.com/brain-resources/everyday-brain-fitness/physical-exercise |website=Brain HQ |access-date=18 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercise stimulates the brain plasticity by stimulating growth of new connections between cells in a wide array of important cortical areas of the brain. Research from UCLA demonstrated that exercise increased growth factors in the brain—making it easier for the brain to grow new neuronal connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Molteni |first1=R |last2=Zheng |first2=JQ |last3=Ying |first3=Z |last4=Gómez-Pinilla |first4=F |last5=Twiss |first5=JL |title=Voluntary exercise increases axonal regeneration from sensory neurons. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=1 June 2004 |volume=101 |issue=22 |pages=8473–8 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0401443101 |pmid=15159540|pmc=420418 |bibcode=2004PNAS..101.8473M |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some benefits of physical activity on brain health happen right after a session of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Benefits include improved thinking or [[cognition]] for children 6 to 13 years of age and reduced short-term feelings of [[anxiety]] for adults. Regular physical activity can help keep your [[thinking]], [[learning]], and [[judgment]] skills sharp as you age. It can also reduce your risk of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and anxiety and help you sleep better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Physical Activity Guidelines |url=https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf#page=39 |website=health.gov |access-date=15 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weight management ===

Both [[Dieting|diet]] and physical activity play a critical role in maintaining a healthy body weight, losing excess body weight, or maintaining successful weight loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Benefits of Physical Activity |url=https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/pa-health/index.htm |website=CDC |access-date=15 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical activity helps control weight by using excess [[calories]] that would otherwise be stored as [[fat]]. Most foods we eat contain calories, and everything we do uses calories, including [[sleeping]], [[breathing]], and [[digesting]] food. Balancing the calories we eat with the calories we use through physical activity will help us reach and maintain a healthy weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Physical Activity and Weight Control |url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/weight-loss/physical-activity-and-weight-control/ |website=MentalHelp.net - An American Addiction Centers Resource |access-date=18 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Long-term benefits ==

The most common health risks include [[cardiovascular]] diseases, [[diabetes]] type 2 and some [[cancers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Benefits of Physical Activity |url=https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/pa-health/index.htm |website=CDC |access-date=15 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Obesity]] is a complex disease that affects whole body [[metabolism]] and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Physical exercise results in numerous health benefits and is an important tool to combat [[obesity]] and its co-morbidities, including cardiovascular disease. Exercise prevents both the onset and development of cardiovascular disease and is an important therapeutic tool to improve outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. Some benefits of exercise include enhanced mitochondrial function, restoration and improvement of vasculature, and the release of myokines from skeletal muscle that preserve or augment cardiovascular function. In this review we will discuss the mechanisms through which exercise promotes cardiovascular health.
Regular physical exercise has several beneficial effects on overall health. While decreasing body mass and adiposity are not the primary outcomes of exercise, exercise can mediate several diseases that accompany obesity including T2D and CVD.
Several recent studies have shown that sustained physical activity is associated with decreased markers of inflammation, improved metabolic health, decreased risk of heart failure, and improved overall survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Effects of Exercise on Cardiovascular Biomarkers: New Insights, Recent Data, and Applications |publisher=Che L., Li D.

There are several risk factors leading to the development and progression of CVD, but one of the most prominent is a sedentary lifestyle. A sedentary lifestyle can be characterized by both obesity and consistently low levels of physical activity. Thus, lifestyle interventions that aim to increase physical activity and decrease obesity are attractive therapeutic methods to combat most non-congenital types of CVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exercise Training Improves Cardiovascular Health |year=2019 |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 |last1=Pinckard |first1=K. |last2=Baskin |first2=K. K. |last3=Stanford |first3=K. I. |journal=Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine |volume=6 |page=69 |pmc=6557987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cardiovascular Risk Factors ===

Regular physical exercise is associated with numerous health benefits to reduce the progression and development of obesity, T2D, and CVD. Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that lifestyle interventions including moderate exercise and a healthy diet improve cardiovascular health in at-risk populations. Individuals with metabolic syndrome who participated in a 4 month program of either a diet (caloric restriction) or exercise intervention had reduced adiposity, decreased systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure, and lower total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lipid profiles compared to the control group. Both the diet and exercise intervention improve these cardiovascular outcomes to a similar extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Physical Activity Decreases Cardiovascular Risk Factors |year=2019 |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 |last1=Pinckard |first1=K. |last2=Baskin |first2=K. K. |last3=Stanford |first3=K. I. |journal=Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine |volume=6 |page=69 |pmc=6557987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several previous studies have investigated the effects of diet and exercise, independently or in combination, on metabolic and cardiovascular health and have determined that diet, exercise, or a combination of diet and exercise induces weight loss, decreases visceral adiposity, lowers plasma triglycerides, plasma glucose, HDL levels, and blood pressure, and improves VO2max. Importantly, several of these beneficial effects of exercise are evident independent of weight loss. Studies have shown that exercise can improve metabolic and cardiovascular health independent of changes in body weight, including improved glucose homeostasis, endothelial function, blood pressure, and HDL levels. These data indicate exercise, independent of changes in body mass, results in significant improvements in cardiovascular and metabolic health. Although a detailed analysis of the vast impact of diet on cardiometabolic health is outside the scope of this review, the importance of diet and exercise in tandem should not be ignored, as many studies have shown that cardiometabolic health is improved to a higher extent in response to a combined diet and exercise programs compared to either intervention alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Physical Activity Decreases Cardiovascular Risk Factors |year=2019 |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 |last1=Pinckard |first1=K. |last2=Baskin |first2=K. K. |last3=Stanford |first3=K. I. |journal=Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine |volume=6 |page=69 |pmc=6557987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exercise has a similar effect on cardiovascular improvements in lean and overweight normoglycemic subjects. In a 1 year study of non-obese individuals, a 16–20% increase in energy expenditure (of any form of exercise) with no diet intervention resulted in a 22.3% decrease in body fat mass and reduced LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol/HDL ratio, and C-reactive protein concentrations, all risk factors associated with CVD. In overweight individuals, 7–9 months of low-intensity exercise (walking ~19 km per week at 40–55% VO2peak) significantly increased cardiorespiratory fitness compared to sedentary individuals. Together these data indicate that exercise interventions decrease the risk or severity of CVD in subjects who are lean, obese, or have type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Physical Activity Decreases Cardiovascular Risk Factors |year=2019 |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 |last1=Pinckard |first1=K. |last2=Baskin |first2=K. K. |last3=Stanford |first3=K. I. |journal=Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine |volume=6 |page=69 |pmc=6557987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cardiac rehabilitation ===

Exercise is also an important [[therapeutic]] treatment for patients who have [[cardiovascular]] diseases. A systematic review of 63 studies found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improved cardiovascular function. These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1–47 months). Overall, exercise significantly reduced CVD-related mortality, decreased risk of MI, and improved quality of life. Another study looked specifically in patients with [[atherosclerosis]] post-revascularization surgery. Patients who underwent 60 min of exercise per day on a cycle ergometer for 4 weeks had an increase blood flow reserve (29%) and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. A recent study provided personalized aerobic exercise rehabilitation programs for patients who had an acute [[myocardial]] infarction for 1 year after a coronary intervention surgery. The patients who underwent the exercise rehabilitation program had increased ejection fraction (60.81 vs. 53% control group), increased exercise tolerance, and reduced cardiovascular risk factors 6 months after starting the exercise rehabilitation program. This improvement in cardiovascular health in patients with atherosclerosis or post-MI is likely the result of increased myocardial perfusion in response to exercise, however more research is required to fully understand these mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Physical Activity Improves Cardiovascular Function in Patients With CVD |year=2019 |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 |last1=Pinckard |first1=K. |last2=Baskin |first2=K. K. |last3=Stanford |first3=K. I. |journal=Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine |volume=6 |page=69 |pmc=6557987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One defining characteristic of [[heart failure]] is [[exercise intolerance]], which resulted in a prescription of bed rest for these patients until the 1950s. However, it has now been shown that a monitored rehabilitation program using moderate intensity exercise is safe for heart failure patients, and this has now become an important therapeutic for patients with heart failure. Meta-analyses and systemic reviews have shown that exercise training in heart failure patients is associated with improved quality of life, reduced risk of [[hospitalization]] and decreased rates of long-term [[Mortality rate|mortality]]. One study of heart failure patients found that aerobic exercise (walking or cycling) at 60–70% of heart rate reserve 3–5 times per week for over 3 years led to improved health and overall quality of life (determined by a self-reported Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, a 23-question disease-specific questionnaire). Other studies have shown that exercise-based rehabilitation at a moderate intensity in heart failure patients improves cardiorespiratory fitness and increases both exercise endurance capacity and VO2max (12–31% increase).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Physical Activity Improves Cardiovascular Function in Patients With CVD |year=2019 |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 |last1=Pinckard |first1=K. |last2=Baskin |first2=K. K. |last3=Stanford |first3=K. I. |journal=Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine |volume=6 |page=69 |pmc=6557987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent studies have examined the effects of high-intensity exercise on patients with heart failure. A recent study found that 12 weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) in heart failure patients (with reduced ejection fraction) was well-tolerated and had similar benefits compared to patients who underwent moderate continuous exercise (MCE) training, including improved left ventricular remodeling and aerobic capacity. A separate study found that 4 weeks of HIIT in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction improved VO2peak and reduced diastolic dysfunction compared to both pre-training values and compared to the MCE group. These studies indicate that both moderate and high intensity exercise training improve cardiovascular function in heart failure patients, likely related to increased endothelium-dependent vasodilation and improved aerobic capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Physical Activity Improves Cardiovascular Function in Patients With CVD |year=2019 |doi=10.3389/fcvm.2019.00069 |pmid=31214598 |last1=Pinckard |first1=K. |last2=Baskin |first2=K. K. |last3=Stanford |first3=K. I. |journal=Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine |volume=6 |page=69 |pmc=6557987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other benefits ==
=== Bones and muscles===

Routine physical activity is important for building strong [[bones]] and [[muscles]] in children, but it is equally important as we get older.  Your bones and muscles work together to support every movement you make on a daily basis. When you are physically active you strengthen your muscles. Your bones adapt by building more cells and as a result both become stronger. Strong bones and muscles protect against injury and improves balance and coordination. In addition active adults experience less joint stiffness and improved [[flexibility]]. This becomes especially important as we get older because it helps to prevent falls and the broken bones that may result. Even if you have [[arthritis]], exercise that keeps the muscles around the joint strong can act like a brace that will react to every move you make without the hassle of an actual brace that you have to put on and take off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PHYSICAL ACTIVITY STRENGTHENS YOUR BONES AND MUSCLES |url=https://raleighboneandjoint.com/news/physical-activity-bones-muscles/ |website=theboneandjoint.com |access-date=20 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Daily activity ===

The ability to perform daily activities and maintain independence requires strong muscles, balance and endurance. Regular physical activity or exercise helps to improve and prevent the decline of muscle strength, balance and endurance, all risk factors for falling. Balance plays an important role in everyday activities such as walking, getting up out of a chair or leaning over to pick up a grandchild. Balance problems can reduce your independence by interfering with activities of daily living. The good news is that participating in regular physical activity can significantly improve balance and reduce your risk for falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND FALL PREVENTION |url=https://fallpreventiontaskforce.org/fall-prevention-topics/physical-activity-fall-prevention/ |website=Fall prevention task force |access-date=21 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental health ===

Exercise is a natural and effective anti-anxiety treatment. It relieves tension and stress, boosts physical and mental energy, and enhances well-being through the release of endorphins. Exercise is also a powerful depression fighter for several reasons. Most importantly, it promotes all kinds of changes in the brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being. It also releases endorphins, powerful chemicals in our brain that energize our spirits and make us feel good. Finally, exercise can also serve as a distraction, allowing us to find some quiet time to break out of the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Mental benefits of exercize |url=https://www.helpguide.org/articles/healthy-living/the-mental-health-benefits-of-exercise.htm |website=HelpGuide.org |access-date=27 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that physical activity benefits mental health, but the "areas in life that present opportunities for physical activity" (or domains) effects mental health differently and therefore should be considered. For example, leisure-time physical activity and active transportation have a positive association with mental health while work-related physical activity is positively associated with mental ill-health. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379716306894&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sleep ===

Exercise triggers an increase in body temperature, and the post-exercise drop in temperature may promote falling asleep. Exercise may also reduce insomnia by decreasing arousal, anxiety and depressive symptoms. Insomnia is commonly linked with elevated arousal, anxiety, and depression, and exercise has effects on reducing these symptoms in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Exercize and Insomnia - Natural remedy |url=https://www.sleepfoundation.org/articles/how-does-exercise-help-those-chronic-insomnia |website=sleepfoundation.org |access-date=27 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues count among the most common among most of population. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S., affecting 40 million adults in the United States age 18 and older, or 18.1% of the population every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Facts &amp; Statistics about anxiety and depression |url=https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics |website=Anxiety and depression association of America |access-date=15 May 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 review suggested that exercise generally improved sleep for most people, and may help with insomnia, but there is insufficient evidence to draw detailed conclusions about the relationship between exercise and sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buman |first1=Matthew P |last2=King |first2=Abby C |title=Exercise as a Treatment to Enhance Sleep |journal=American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine |date=2010 |volume=4 |issue=6 |pages=500–514 |doi=10.1177/1559827610375532 |s2cid=73314918 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that physical activity has little association with sleep in healthy children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Antzcak |first1=Devan |last2=Lonsdale |first2=Chris |last3=Lee |first3=Jane |last4=Hilland |first4=Toni |last5=Duncan |first5=Mitch |last6=del Pozo Cruz |first6=Borja |last7=Hulteen |first7=Ryan |last8=Parker |first8=Philip |last9=Sanders |first9=Taren |title=Physical activity and sleep are inconsistently related in healthy children: A systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews |date=2020 |volume=51 |page=101278 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2020.101278 |pmid=32155572 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Physical fitness''' is a state of [[health]] and [[well-being]] and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of [[Outline of sports|sports]], occupations and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper [[nutrition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tremblay MS, Colley RC, Saunders TJ, Healy GN, Owen N | title = Physiological and health implications of a sedentary lifestyle | journal = Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism| volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 725–40 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21164543 | doi = 10.1139/H10-079 }}&lt;/ref&gt; moderate-vigorous [[physical exercise]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Groot GC, Fagerström L | title = Older adults' motivating factors and barriers to exercise to prevent falls | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 153–60 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 20545467 | doi = 10.3109/11038128.2010.487113 | s2cid = 41105819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sufficient rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Physical activity and health of youth | vauthors = Malina R  | publisher = Ovidius University Annals, Series Physical Education and Sport/Science, Movement and Health|year = 2010|location = Constanta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the industrial revolution, ''fitness'' was defined as the capacity to carry out the day’s activities without undue fatigue. However, with automation and changes in lifestyles ''physical fitness'' is now considered a measure of the body's ability to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, to be healthy, to resist [[hypokinetic diseases]], and to meet emergency situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports Definitions for Health, Fitness, and Physical Activity |url=http://www.fitness.gov/digest_mar2000.htm |archive-date=12 July 2012 |publisher=fitness.gov |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712201046/http://www.fitness.gov/digest_mar2000.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Fitness is defined as the quality or state of being fit and healthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fitness|title=Merriam-Webster Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1950, perhaps consistent with the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the treatise of [[World War II]], the term "fitness" increased in western vernacular by a factor of ten.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=7&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;content=fitness&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Cfitness%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bfitness%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BFitness%3B%2Cc0 "Google Ngram Viewer"]. Google.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern definition of fitness describes either a person or machine's ability to perform a specific function or a holistic definition of human adaptability to cope with various situations. This has led to an interrelation of human fitness and attractiveness that has mobilized global fitness and fitness equipment industries. Regarding specific function, fitness is attributed to persons who possess significant [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] or [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] ability, i.e. endurance or strength. A well-rounded fitness program improves a person in all aspects of fitness compared to practicing only one, such as only cardio/respiratory endurance or only weight training.

A comprehensive fitness program tailored to an individual typically focuses on one or more specific skills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skill-related physical fitness essential for sports success|url=http://www.tradoc.army.mil/pao/Web_specials/H_and_PWB/013204.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617084150/http://www.tradoc.army.mil/pao/Web_specials/H_and_PWB/013204.htm|archive-date=June 2011|work=tradoc.army.mil|date=19 January 2004| last = Colfer | first = George R. | name-list-style = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on age-&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nied RJ, Franklin B | title = Promoting and prescribing exercise for the elderly | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 65 | issue = 3 | pages = 419–26 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11858624 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0201/p419.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; or health-related needs such as bone health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Bone/Bone_Health/Exercise/default.asp "Exercise for Your Bone Health"]. nih.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4177.0 | title = Participation in Sport and Physical Recreation, Australia | date = 18 February 2015    | publisher = Australian Bureau of Statistics }}&lt;/ref&gt; also cite [[mental health|mental]], [[social health|social]] and [[emotional health]] as an important part of overall fitness.

Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as [[myokine]]s, which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pedersen BK, Febbraio MA | title = Muscles, exercise, and obesity: skeletal muscle as a secretory organ | journal = Nature Reviews.

== Activity guidelines ==
{{Cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=August 2019}}
The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans were released by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to provide science-based guidance for people ages 3 years and older to improve their health by participating in regular physical activity. These guidelines recommend that all adults should move more and sit less throughout the day to improve health-related quality of life including mental, emotional, and physical health. For substantial health benefits, adults should perform at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity, or 75 to 150 minutes per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both spread throughout the week. The recommendation for physical activity to occur in bouts of at least 10 minutes has been eliminated as new research suggests that bouts of any length contribute to the health benefits linked to the accumulated volume of physical activity.

New guidelines in the United Kingdom released in July 2011 include the following points:
The intensity at which a person exercises is key, and light activity such as strolling and housework is unlikely to have much positive impact on the health of most people. For aerobic exercise to be beneficial, it must raise the [[heart rate]] and cause [[perspiration]]. A person should do a minimum of 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, although that is the minimum in actual fact. There are more health benefits gained if a person exercises beyond 150 minutes.
Sedentary time (time spent not standing, such as when on the toilet or in bed) is bad for a person's health, and no amount of exercise can negate the effects of sitting for too long.
These guidelines are now much more in line with those used in the U.S., which also includes recommendations for muscle-building and bone-strengthening activities such as lifting weights and yoga.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nhs.uk/news/lifestyle-and-exercise/major-new-exercise-guidelines-announced/&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. guidelines continue: Additional health benefits may be achieved by engaging in more than 300 minutes (5 hours) of moderate-intensity physical activity per week. Adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities that are of moderate or greater intensity and involve all major muscle groups on two or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/Physical_Activity_Guidelines_2nd_edition.pdf | title = Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans 2nd edition | publisher = U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | date = 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exercise ==
{{Main|Exercise}}

=== Aerobic exercise ===
{{Main|Aerobic exercise}}
[[Cardiorespiratory fitness]] can be measured using [[VO2 max]], a measure of the amount of oxygen the body can uptake and utilize.&lt;ref name="r27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23025219"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Chakravertty B, Parkavi K, Coumary SA, Felix AJ | title = Antepartum cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) quantification by estimation of maximal oxygen consumption (Vo2 max) in pregnant South Indian women | journal = Journal of the Indian Medical Association | volume = 110 | issue = 4 | pages = 214–7 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 23025219 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerobic exercise, which improves cardiorespiratory fitness, involves movement that increases the heart rate to improve the body's oxygen consumption. This form of exercise is an important part of all training regiments ranging from professional athletes to the everyday person. Also, it helps increase stamina.
[[File:Playing basketball in ASTU.jpg|thumb|300x300px|Playing sports such as [[basketball]] is a common way to maintain/improve physical fitness]]
Examples are:

*[[Jogging]] –  Running at a steady and gentle pace. This form of exercise is great for maintaining weight and building a cardiovascular base to later perform more intense exercises.
* Elliptical training – This is a stationary [[exercise machine]] used to perform [[walking]], or [[running]] without causing excessive stress on the joints. This form of exercise is perfect for people with achy hips, knees, and ankles.
*[[Walking]] – Moving at a fairly regular pace for a short, medium or long distance.
*[[Treadmill]] training – Many treadmills have programs set up that offer numerous different workout plans. One effective cardiovascular activity would be to switch between running and walking. Typically warm up first by walking and then switch off between walking for three minutes and running for three minutes.
*[[Human swimming|Swimming]] – Using the arms and legs to keep oneself afloat and moving either forwards or backward. This is a good full-body exercise for those who are looking to strengthen their core while improving cardiovascular endurance.
*[[Cycling]] – Riding a bicycle typically involves longer distances than walking or jogging. This is another low-impact exercise on the joints and is great for improving leg strength.&lt;ref name="r29" /&gt;

=== Anaerobic exercise ===
{{Main|Anaerobic exercise}}

Anaerobic exercise features high-intensity movements performed in a short period of time. It is a fast, high-intensity exercise that doesn’t require the body to utilize oxygen to produce energy. It helps to promote strength, endurance, speed, and power; and is used by bodybuilders to build workout intensity. Thought to increase the metabolic rate which, allows you to burn additional calories as the body recovers from exercise due to an increase in body temperature and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) after the exercise ended.

Examples are:

* Weight lifting - A common type of [[strength training]] for developing the strength and size of skeletal muscles. 
*[[Isometric exercise]] - Helps to maintain strength. A muscle action in which no visible movement occurs and the resistance matches the muscular tension.
*[[Sprinting]] - Running short distances as fast as possible.
* Interval training - Alternating short bursts (lasting around 30 seconds) of intense activity with longer intervals (three to four minutes) of less intense activity.

== Training ==
{{anchor|PT}}

Specific or task-oriented fitness is a person's ability to perform in a specific activity with a reasonable efficiency: for example, sports or [[military service]]. Specific training prepares athletes to perform well in their sport.

Examples are:
* [[100 m sprint]]: In a sprint, the athlete must be trained to work anaerobically throughout the race, an example of how to do this would be interval training.
* [[Century ride|Century Ride]]: Cyclists must be prepared aerobically for a bike ride of 100 miles or more.
* [[Middle distance running]]: Athletes require both speed and endurance to gain benefit out of this training. The hard-working muscles are at their peak for a longer period of time as they are being used at that level for the longer period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.brianmac.co.uk/middist/index.htm|title = Middle Distance Running|year = 2001|website = Middle Distance Running|publisher = BrianMac Sports Coach|vauthors = Mackenzie B }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Marathon]]: In this case, the athlete must be trained to work aerobically and their endurance must be built-up to a maximum.
* Many firefighters and police officers undergo regular [[Physical fitness test|fitness testing]] to determine if they are capable of the physically demanding tasks required of the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sccfd.org/physical_fitness.html#appendix2 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140630055700/http://sccfd.org/physical_fitness.html#appendix2 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2014-06-30 | title = Training: Physical Fitness Program | work = sccfd.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Members of [[armed forces]] are often required to pass a formal fitness test. For example, soldiers of the [[U.S. Army]] must be able to pass the [[Army Physical Fitness Test]] (APFT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enlist : Army Physical Fitness Test | url = http://www.army.com/enlist/APFT.html |work=Army.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106111832/http://www.army.com/enlist/APFT.html |archive-date=6 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hill sprints: Requires a high level of fitness to begin with; the exercise is particularly good for the leg muscles. The Army often trains to do mountain climbing and races.
* [[Plyometrics|Plyometric]] and [[isometric exercise]]s: An excellent way to build strength and increase muscular endurance.
* [[Beach running|Sand running]] creates less strain on leg muscles than running on grass or concrete. This is because sand collapses beneath the foot, softening the landing. Sand training is an effective way to lose weight and become fit, as more effort is needed (one and a half times more) to run on the soft sand than on a hard surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Running on the Beach: The Benefits &amp; Dangers |work = Runners Feed |url = http://runnersfeed.com/running-on-the-beach-the-benefits-dangers/ |access-date = 2015-04-14 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150901211049/http://runnersfeed.com/running-on-the-beach-the-benefits-dangers/ |archive-date = 1 September 2015 |url-status = dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aquajogging]] is a form of exercise that decreases strain on joints and bones. The water supplies minimal impact{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=February 2016}} to muscles and bones, which is good for those recovering from injury. Furthermore, the resistance of the water as one jogs through it provides an enhanced effect of exercise (the deeper you are the greater the force needed to pull your leg through).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.livestrong.com/article/444522-aqua-jogging-for-runners/ | title = Aqua Jogging for Runners|date = 28 January 2015|website = livestrong.com|last = Harriman|first = Dan | name-list-style = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For physical fitness activity to benefit an individual, the exertion triggers a response called a stimulus. Exercise with the correct amount of intensity, duration, and frequency can produce a significant amount of improvement. The person may overall feel better, but the physical effects on the human body take weeks or months to notice and possibly years for full development. For training purposes, exercise must provide a stress or demand on either a function or tissue. To continue improvements, this demand must eventually increase little over an extended period of time. This sort of exercise training has three basic principles: overload, specificity, and progression.  These principles are related to health but also enhancement of physical working capacity.&lt;ref name= Blair&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Blair SN | title = 1993 C.H.

=== High intensity interval training ===
{{Main|High-intensity interval training}}
High-intensity interval training (HIIT) consists of repeated, short bursts of exercise, completed at a high level of intensity. These sets of intense activity are followed by a predetermined time of rest or low-intensity activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wisløff U, Ellingsen Ø, Kemi OJ|date=July 2009|title=High-intensity interval training to maximize cardiac benefits of exercise training?|journal=Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews|volume=37|issue=3|pages=139–46|doi=10.1097/JES.0b013e3181aa65fc|pmid=19550205|s2cid=25057561|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cb50a802ef2e8e4de2ac32ad0a0f1d2a71359412}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have shown that exercising at a higher intensity has increased cardiac benefits for humans, compared to when exercising at a low or moderate level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gillen JB, Gibala MJ|date=March 2014|title=Is high-intensity interval training a time-efficient exercise strategy to improve health and fitness?|journal=Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism|volume=39|issue=3|pages=409–12|doi=10.1139/apnm-2013-0187|pmid=24552392}}&lt;/ref&gt; When your workout consists of a HIIT session, your body has to work harder to replace the oxygen it lost.

== Effects ==
{{Main|Exercise physiology}}

=== Controlling blood pressure ===
Physical fitness has proven to result in positive effects on the body's blood pressure because staying active and exercising regularly builds up a stronger heart. The heart is the main organ in charge of [[systolic|systolic blood pressure]] and [[diastolic blood pressure]]. Engaging in a physical activity raises blood pressure. Once the subject stops the activity, the blood pressure returns to normal. The more physical activity that one engages in, the easier this process becomes, resulting in a more ‘fit’ individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/high-blood-pressure/art-20045206 | title = Exercise: A Drug-free Approach to Lowering High Blood Pressure | work = mayoclinic.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through regular physical fitness, the heart does not have to work as hard to create a rise in blood pressure, which lowers the force on the arteries, and lowers the overall blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bloodpressureuk.org/BloodPressureandyou/Yourlifestyle/Beingactive | title = Blood Pressure : Exercise &amp; Activity Lower Blood Pressure | work = bloodpressureuk.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancer prevention ===
Centers for disease control and prevention provide lifestyle guidelines for maintaining a balanced diet and engaging in physical activity to reduce the risk of disease. The WCRF/ [[American Institute for Cancer Research]]  (AICR) published a list of recommendations that reflect the evidence they have found through consistency in fitness and dietary factors that directly relate to cancer prevention.

The WCRF/AICR recommendations include the following: 
* Be as lean as possible without becoming underweight.
* Each week, adults should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity.
* Children should engage in at least one hour of moderate or vigorous physical activity each week.
* Be physically active for at least thirty minutes every day.
* Avoid [[sugar]], and limit the consumption of energy-packed foods.
* Balance one's diet with a variety of vegetables, grains, fruits, legumes, etc.
* Limit [[sodium]] intake, the consumption of red meats, and the consumption of processed meats.
* Limit alcoholic drinks to two for men and one for women a day.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Alberts, David S. and Hess, Lisa M. (2005). ''Fundamentals of Cancer Prevention''. Berlin: Springer, {{ISBN|364238983X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These recommendations are also widely supported by the [[American Cancer Society]].  The guidelines have been evaluated and individuals that have higher guideline adherence scores substantially reduce cancer risk as well as help control a multitude of chronic health problems. Regular physical activity is a factor that helps reduce an individual’s blood pressure and improves cholesterol levels, two key components that correlate with heart disease and [[Type 2 Diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. [https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/sgr/pdf/sgrfull.pdf ''Physical Activity and Health: A Report of the Surgeon General'']. Atlanta, GA: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The American Cancer Society encourages the public to "adopt a physically active lifestyle" by meeting the criteria in a variety of physical activities such as hiking, swimming, circuit training, resistance training, lifting, etc. It is understood that cancer is not a disease that can be cured by physical fitness alone, however, because it is a multifactorial disease, physical fitness is a controllable prevention. The large associations tied with being physically fit and reduced cancer risk are enough to provide a strategy to reduce cancer risk.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The American Cancer Society asserts different levels of activity ranging from moderate to vigorous to clarify the recommended time spent on a physical activity. These classifications of physical activity consider intentional exercise and basic activities performed on a daily basis and give the public a greater understanding of what fitness levels suffice as future disease prevention.

=== Inflammation ===
Studies have shown an association between increased physical activity and reduced inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Colbert LH, Visser M, Simonsick EM, Tracy RP, Newman AB, Kritchevsky SB, Pahor M, Taaffe DR, Brach J, Rubin S, Harris TB | title = Physical activity, exercise, and inflammatory markers in older adults: findings from the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study | journal = Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | volume = 52 | issue = 7 | pages = 1098–104 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15209647 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2004.52307.x | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1230665 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It produces both a short-term inflammatory response and a long-term anti-inflammatory effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kasapis C, Thompson PD | title = The effects of physical activity on serum C-reactive protein and inflammatory markers: a systematic review | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 45 | issue = 10 | pages = 1563–9 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15893167 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2004.12.077 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical activity reduces inflammation in conjunction with or independent of changes in body weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campbell KL, McTiernan A | title = Exercise and biomarkers for cancer prevention studies | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 137 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = 161S–169S | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17182820 | doi = 10.1093/jn/137.1.161S | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mechanisms linking physical activity to inflammation are unknown.

=== Immune system ===
Physical activity boosts the [[immune system]]. This is dependent on the concentration of endogenous factors (such as sex hormones, metabolic hormones and growth hormones), body temperature, blood flow, hydration status and body position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nieman DC | title = Exercise immunology: practical applications | journal = International Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 18 Suppl 1 | pages = S91–100 | date = March 1997 | pmid = 9129268 | doi = 10.1055/s-2007-972705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical activity has shown to increase the levels of natural killer (NK) cells, NK T cells, macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils, complements, cytokines, antibodies and T cytotoxic cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fairey AS, Courneya KS, Field CJ, Mackey JR | title = Physical exercise and immune system function in cancer survivors: a comprehensive review and future directions | journal = Cancer | volume = 94 | issue = 2 | pages = 539–51 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11900239 | doi = 10.1002/cncr.10244 | s2cid = 24526200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kruijsen-Jaarsma M, Révész D, Bierings MB, Buffart LM, Takken T | title = Effects of exercise on immune function in patients with cancer: a systematic review | journal = Exercise Immunology Review | volume = 19 | pages = 120–43 | date = 2013-01-01 | pmid = 23977724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the mechanism linking physical activity to immune system is not fully understood.

=== Weight control ===
{{Main|Weight control}}
{{See also|healthy diet}}
Achieving resilience through physical fitness promotes a vast and complex range of health-related benefits. Individuals who keep up physical fitness levels generally regulate their distribution of body fat and prevent obesity. Abdominal fat, specifically visceral fat, is most directly affected by engaging in aerobic exercise. Strength training has been known to increase the amount of muscle in the body, however, it can also reduce body fat.&lt;ref name=r28/&gt; Sex steroid hormones, insulin, and appropriate immune responses are factors that mediate metabolism in relation to abdominal fat. Therefore, physical fitness provides weight control through regulation of these bodily functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Westerlind KC | title = Physical activity and cancer prevention--mechanisms | journal = Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise | volume = 35 | issue = 11 | pages = 1834–40 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14600547 | doi = 10.1249/01.MSS.0000093619.37805.B7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Menopause and physical fitness ===
[[Menopause]] is often said to have occurred when a woman has had no vaginal bleeding for over a year since her last [[menstrual cycle]]. There are a number of symptoms connected to menopause, most of which can affect the quality of life of a woman involved in this stage of her life. One way to reduce the severity of the symptoms is to exercise and keep a healthy level of fitness.  Prior to and during menopause, as the female body changes, there can be physical, physiological or internal changes to the body. These changes can be reduced or even prevented with regular exercise. These changes include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Sternfeld B, Dugan S | title = Physical activity and health during the menopausal transition | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 537–66 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21961719 | pmc = 3270074 | doi = 10.1016/j.ogc.2011.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Preventing weight gain: around menopause women tend to experience a reduction in muscle mass and an increase in fat levels. Increasing the amount of physical exercise undertaken can help to prevent these changes.
* Reducing the risk of [[breast cancer]]: weight loss from regular exercise may offer protection from breast cancer.
* Strengthening bones: physical activity can slow the bone loss associated with menopause, reducing the chance of bone fractures and osteoporosis.
* Reducing the risk of disease: excess weight can increase the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, and regular physical activity can counter these effects.
* Boosting mood: being involved in regular activities can improve psychological health, an effect that can be seen at any age and not just during or after [[menopause]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/womens-health/in-depth/fitness-tips-for-menopause/art-20044602 | title = Fitness Tips for Menopause: Why fitness counts | date = June 2013 | access-date = 11 April 2015 | publisher = Mayo Clinic | last = Pruthi | first = Sandhya | name-list-style = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Melbourne Women's Midlife Health Project followed 438 women over an eight-year period providing evidence showing that even though physical activity was not associated with VMS in this cohort at the beginning, Women who reported they were physically active every day at the beginning were 49% less likely to have reported bothersome hot flushes. This is in contrast to women whose level of activity decreased and were more likely to experience bothersome hot flushes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.acsm.org/access-public-information/articles/2012/01/12/exercise-recommendations-for-menopause-aged-women|title = Exercise Recommendations for Menopause-Aged Women|date = January 12, 2012|access-date = 12 April 2015|website = American College of Sports Medicine|publisher = American College of Sports Medicine|last = Eschbach|first = Chris | name-list-style = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Studies have shown a reduction in stress levels.
* Increased opportunity for social interaction, allowing for improved social skills&lt;ref name="Sharma_2006" /&gt;

To achieve some of these benefits, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests at least 30–60 minutes of exercise 3-5 times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/pa-health/index.htm|title=Benefits of Physical Activity|date=2018-03-06|work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Calisthenics, 1867. Granger Collection.jpg|thumb|Ladies performing a common 19th-century fitness routine including climbing the underside of a ladder, balancing and gymnastics.]]
Physical fitness has always been an important part of life. It is theorized that when people left a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and formed fixed communities based around agriculture that physical fitness levels declined.  This is not to say that levels of physical labor decreased but that the type of work undertaken was not necessarily as conducive to a general level of fitness. As such, regimented fitness regimes were either invented or became more common. This was especially the case in classical civilizations such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Rome]]. In Greece, physical fitness was considered to be an essential component of a healthy life and it was the norm for men to frequent a [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]]. Physical fitness regimes were also considered to be of paramount importance in a nation's ability to train soldiers for an effective military force. Partly for these reasons, organized fitness regimes have been in existence throughout known history and evidence of them can be found in many countries.

Gymnasiums which would seem familiar today began to become increasingly common in the 19th century. The industrial revolution had led to a more sedentary lifestyle for many people and there was an increased awareness that this had the potential to be harmful to health. This was a key motivating factor for the forming of a [[physical culture]] movement, especially in Europe and the USA. This movement advocated increased levels of physical fitness for men, women, and children and sought to do so through various forms of indoor and outdoor activity, and education. In many ways, it laid the foundations for modern fitness culture.&lt;ref&gt;https://exercise.lovetoknow.com/Physical_Fitness_History&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical training has been present in human societies throughout history. Usually, it was performed for the purposes of preparing for physical competition or display, improving physical and mental health, and looking attractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=William D. McArdle, Frank I. Katch, Victor L. |title=Exercise Physiology: Nutrition, Energy, and Human Performance |date=2010 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Baltimore |isbn=9780781797818 |pages=xviii-xxvii |edition=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took a variety of different forms but quick dynamic exercises were favoured over slow or more static ones. For example, running, jumping, wrestling, gymnastics and throwing heavy stones are mentioned frequently in historical sources and emphasised as being highly effective training methods. Notably, they are also forms of exercise which are readily achievable for most people to some extent or another.

Physical training was widely practiced by the athletes of Ancient Greece. However, after the [[Ancient Olympic Games|original Olympic Games]] were banned by the Romans in 394, such culturally significant athletic competitions were not held again until the 19th Century. In 1896, the [[Olympic Games]] were reintroduced after a gap of some 1500 years. In the years in between, formalised systems of physical training had become more closely aligned with military training. Whilst there were differences in how the training manifested itself based upon what it was in preparation for there were also obvious similarities, and similar training methods and focuses can be seen to recur throughout European history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zeigler |first1=Earle F. |title=Socio-cultural Foundations of Physical Education &amp; Educational Sport |date=2003 |publisher=AAchen |location=Oxford |isbn=1841260932 |pages=55–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Throwing a heavy stone (a stone put).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gardinier |first1=E. Norman |title=Athletics of the Ancient World |date=1930 |publisher=OUP |location=London |pages=26, 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller stones were thrown one handed from the shoulder. The heaviest record of a stone throw from the period is Bybon's stone which was found at [[Olympia, Greece]]. It is 316 ibs (143.5&amp;nbsp;kg), has a handle, and an inscription which states it was thrown over the head one handed by [[Bybon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gardinier |first1=E. Norman |title=Olympia Its History &amp; Remains |date=1925 |publisher=OUP |location=London |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gardinier |first1=E. Norman |title=Athletics of the Ancient World |date=1930 |publisher=OUP |location=London |pages=26, 54}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique for the throw would be similar to the 'bag over bar' modern [[strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] event. Military accounts detail heavy stones being thrown as a form of projectile weapon, with even gates being broken open in this manner. This suggests the stones were of significant weight and that warriors trained in this regard in order to be able to perform the feat successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Homer |first1=translator: W. Munford |title=Homer's Iliad, volume 1. |date=1846 |publisher=Charles C. Little and James Brown |location=Boston |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Throwing a discus. Metal discuses weighed between 3-12 1/2&amp;nbsp;lbs, and stone discuses up to 15&amp;nbsp;lbs.
*Throwing a javelin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gardinier |first1=E. Norman |title=Athletics of the Ancient World |date=1930 |publisher=OUP |location=London |page= 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Throwing a tree trunk&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plyometrics'''
{{Main|Plyometrics}}
*Long jumps from standing with specially shaped jumping weights ([[halteres]]) held in the hands.  For a jump from standing, one foot is positioned forward and one foot back. The weights are swung up and down until the jumper jumps in conjunction with an upswing. The long jump could also be performed without weights, and with a running start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |pages=144, 151}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Vertical jumps as high as possible. Some descriptions state the legs are kicked out behind during the jump. This may refer to the natural movement of the legs which occurs during a powerful upwards jump. Vases ([[amphorae]]) show a vertical jump with the jumpers looking sideways, which also precipitates a movement of the bent, lower legs in this direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Two-handled storage jar (pelike) depicting young athletes jumping |url=https://collections.mfa.org/objects/153847 |website=Museum of Fine Arts Boston |access-date=13 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Jumping up and down and alternately extending the legs forwards and backwards.
*Jumping (meant generally)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gardinier |first1=E. Norman |title=Athletics of the Ancient World |date=1930 |publisher=OUP |location=London |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Jumping whilst wearing armour.
*Vaulting onto horseback with a pole ([[pole vaulting]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calisthenics'''
{{Main|Calisthenics}}
*Drill type exercises such as may be found on a modern parade ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Running. Different varieties of running were practiced such as running whilst carrying halteres, in armour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |pages=35, 140}}&lt;/ref&gt; in heavy sand, incorporating jumps along the way ([[hurdling]]), running whilst turning a large ring ([[hula hoop]]) along the ground by their side with a stick, and running whilst carrying a large metal tripod, running in a decreasing or increasing circle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst holding a torch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Marching on the forefeet while swinging the arms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Gymnastics including acrobatics, tumbling, and rhythmic dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dancing. Various dances were performed, including the Pyrrhic dance was a war dance which imitated battlefield actions of attack and defence. It involved quick dynamic actions such as bending to one side, crouching down, leaping up etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Swimming and diving&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |pages=54, 93}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Driving a chariot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rope climbing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Empty handed dumbbell movements with the hands open or clenched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Co-operative calisthenics'''
*Holding the arms extended while another person tries to push them down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Strength and weight training'''
{{Main|Strength training|Weight training}}
*[[Stone lifting]]. A 480&amp;nbsp;kg stone found at Santorin is inscribed with the statement 'Eumastas, the son of Critobulus, lifted me from the ground.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Carrying a heavy weight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Rowing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Digging]]. This was for two reasons. Firstly, the sand in the gymnasium was dug over daily with a pick before being rolled flat again. Secondly, digging was performed as an exercise in its own right and was especially popular with boxers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |pages=84, 93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Using halteres as dumbbells in a rapid fashion including in swinging motions. Halteres ranged from between 2 1/4 and 10&amp;nbsp;lbs. Movement ranges mentioned in connection with this exercise include bending and straightening the arms, sideways movements, lunging in the style of a boxer, and bending and straightening the trunk. Another exercise described by the physician Galen, consists of placing the halteres six feet apart and standing between them. The exerciser picks up the left haltere with his right hand, and then the right haltere with his left hand, replaces them, and continues to repeat the sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |pages=92, 97, 153}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The addition of weights or armour to calisthenic exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Games and sports played for fitness'''
*[[Wrestling]] was considered fundamentally important to contemporary fitness regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Boxing]]. Boxing exercises included hitting a punch bag and practicing punching actions whilst holding dumbbells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |pages=53, 84, 122, fig.78}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pankration]], (similar to modern [[MMA]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |pages=70, 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hockey]], the rules are unclear but it involved similar shaped clubs, ball, and bent over playing postures as the modern game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=fig.213}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Platanistas, a game popular in Sparta. Two teams enter an island over opposite bridges. The island is surrounded by water filled ditches and each team attempts to drive their opponents into the water using a variety of striking and wrestling techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ball games]]. Striking a ball against the ground or wall and hitting it again when it rebounded. Similar to the game of '[[fives]]' in this respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |pages=84, 230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amphorae show some ball games were played in a piggy-back style where one person was carried on the back of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercising with a small ball at any pace and using any desired rules and techniques, solitarily or with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sky ball'', a player throws a ball into the air, and he and other players try to catch it.

''Epikoinos'', a game involving two teams of equal numbers and a ball which was roughly the size of a large apple. The two teams line up in a staggered formation either side of a centre line i.e. player 1 is closest to the line, player 2 midway and player 3 furthest, and the same for the opposite team. The centre line was marked out of gypsum or stone, and called skyros or latype. There was a goal line some distance behind each team. At the set up of the game the ball is placed on the centre line. When the game begins, each team races to secure the ball. Whoever secures the ball then attempts to throw it over and beyond their opponents who attempt to catch it and return it in a similar manner. By following this process, the aim of the game is to force the opposing team back over their goal line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |page=235, fig.212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harpastum]], the gameplay is not fully clear but involves players passing to each other in a bid to avoid an opposing player who is attempting to intercept the ball. It also involves feinting to fool the opposition and dodging out of the way. Non-active players would wait to join in the game, perhaps standing around in a circle to demark the playing area. A waiting player could be allowed into the game by an active player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ibid |pages=233–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ballistic training'''
*Throwing the stone. A one-handed throw of a stone from the shoulder is among the more common exercises displayed in medieval artwork. The thrower holds the stone above their shoulder and turns their body sideways on to the desired direction of travel. They shift their bodyweight so it is predominantly over the foot which is the same side as the stone. They then throw the stone as hard as they can which involves a shift of the bodyweight to the other foot. Throwing heavy stones is also an exercise, a knightly pursuit, recommended by the fencing master Hans Talhoffer.&lt;ref name="HROARR"/&gt;

'''Plyometrics'''
*Jumping 
*Skipping along (without a rope)

'''Calisthenics'''
*Climbing. Climbing up the inside of a narrow tower, or between two walls, using pressure from the hands and feet, or other parts of their body. Climbing up the corner of two perpendicular walls using pressure from the arms and legs.&lt;ref name="HROARR"/&gt;
*Climbing up the underside of a ladder.
*Dancing vigorously, including in armour.
*Marching carrying weight, including uphill.
*Gymnastics including acrobatics and tumbling. Knights would perform somersaults in full plate armour but without the helmet.
*Vaulting, especially onto or over a horse or wooden horse.
*Long marches carrying weight uphill.&lt;ref name="HROARR"/&gt;
*Horse riding including practicing turning on horseback&lt;ref name="HROARR"/&gt;
*Wall running i.e. running up a wall and grabbing the top edge. Similar to what is practiced in modern [[parkour]].
*Running and jumping.&lt;ref name="HROARR"/&gt;
*Gymnastics including bridges and handstands.&lt;ref name="HROARR"/&gt;
*Hunting

==Common training focuses==

The main training focus which is shared across all historical periods is the achieving of good general health through physical fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gardinier |first1=E. Norman |title=Athletics of the Ancient World |date=1930 |publisher=OUP |location=London |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most obvious visual sign for a person achieving this was looking ‘in shape’. Or in other words, the body's muscular proportions being in the correct ratio to each other, having good posture in general, and not carrying too much or too little fat.

When physical training was used to prepare for athletics or warfare, the focus was predominantly on agility, speed, explosive power, and endurance. There was little attempt to emulate the hardiness and physical strength of the peasant or manual labourer, because the kind of strength developed by those roles was considered too slow and unagile for competition, be it in athletics or war.&lt;ref name="HROARR"/&gt; For this reason exercises which required powerful, dynamic movements were more frequently recommended than those which required slow moving strength i.e. ballistic training and plyometrics more so than heavy weight lifting.

Representations of athletes and warriors typically have very similar body proportions: a large full torso, large or very large gluteal muscles, and a build which overall looks muscular, athletic and robust. The commonality of this body shape for people throughout history who have undergone physical training means it was a build which was the result of, and reciprocally supported the further achievement of, the training goals of agility, speed, explosive power, and endurance.&lt;ref name="F word"/&gt;

Athletes, especially in Greece and Rome, tended to be thicker set than warriors who were in general leaner. This was partly due to athletes being able to depend on regular meals and sleep patterns, and warriors having to be prepared to be deprived of these. Thus, it was easier for an athlete to maintain a more muscular frame, whereas it was an unnecessary and difficult task for a warrior involved in campaigning. The relative proportions of the build were however similar which shows there was a belief in optimum physical proportions which could place someone in the best situation to achieve a variety of tasks. On this subject the historian E. Norman Gardinier notes that while in Ancient Greece there were variations in the builds of the athletes based upon the event they specialised in, these variations were slight and that there was a universal standard of development which was the result of universal forms of athletic training. He goes on to argue that for this reason statues of athletes would be made with a sign of the event they specialised in, otherwise it would be too difficult to tell them apart based upon their physical development alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gardinier |first1=E. Norman |title=Athletics of the Ancient World |date=1930 |publisher=OUP |location=London |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; For similar reasons of attempting to achieve the optimum body proportions for moving in a fast, agile, and powerful manner, people throughout history, who have undertaken physical training, tend to be of similar proportions.

==Women’s physical training==
{{See also|20th century women's fitness culture}}
Women's physical training had many similarities to men's but was markedly tailored towards their physical requirements. This generally meant it focused on agility and speed, but not power or endurance to the same extent as men.  In general, the training was notably less intense than that undertaken by men. This was due to inter-related physiological and cultural reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chisholm |first1=Ann |title=The disciplinary dimensions of nineteenth-century gymnastics for US women |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09523360601157172 |journal=The International Journal of the History of Sport |year=2007 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=432–479 |doi=10.1080/09523360601157172 |s2cid=143593453 |access-date=13 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main physiological reasons women were not supposed to train like men were related to fertility. Whilst discussion on women's physical training is relatively scarce in historical sources, there are two reasons which predominate. Considered in the context of 19th Century France, the first is that intense physical training was not compatible with a woman's menstrual cycle. The two together could lead to exhaustion, especially during adolescence. For similar reasons it was considered to be incompatible with pregnancy and periods of breast feeding. The second reason is that intense physical training tended to involve, or be preparation for, direct physical competition which would involve taking various knocks and impacts. It was considered that if a woman was struck in the area of her uterus it could cause long term damage, and negatively affect fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=Mark |title=Sport, Health and the Body in the History of Physical Education |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxon |pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst it is unclear to what extent such positions applied to women's training throughout history, it is clear that intense and prolonged physical training, and full contact games have been avoided in general. There are however notable exceptions, such as the [[Amazons|Amazon]] warrioresses whose profession necessitated being able to compete in an [[Amazonomachy|intensely physical environment]].

The more common exercises which were undertaken by women include running (including sprinting), light stone or shot put, light dumbbell exercises, archery, fencing, swinging Indian clubs, swimming, ball games, racket sports, and various forms of gymnastics. The [[Heraean Games]] were the women's equivalent of the [[Ancient Olympic Games]] and took place prior to the men's competitions. According to the historian E. Norman Gardinier:
{{Quote| At the festival there were races for maidens of various ages. Their course was 500 feet, or one-sixth less than the men's stadium. The maidens ran with their hair down their backs, a short tunic reaching just below the knee, and their right shoulder bare to the breast. The victors received crowns of olive and a share of the heifer sacrificed to [[Hera]]. They had, too, the right of setting up their statues in the [[Temple of Hera, Olympia|Heraeum]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, E. Norman, 'The Rise of the Athletic Festival' in ''Greek Athletic Sport and Festivals'', London:MacMillan, 1910, pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; }} It is notable that historical artwork which depicts women, on average, shows them with significantly smaller breasts than women in the modern day. Women athletes and warrioresses tend to be represented either not wearing any form of breast support or, more rarely, use a breast band, such as is demonstrated in the Roman 'bikini girls' mosaic.

Understanding the relationship between [[cardiorespiratory fitness]] and other categories of conditioning requires a review of changes that occur with increased aerobic, or anaerobic capacity. As aerobic/anaerobic capacity increases, general [[metabolism]] rises, muscle metabolism is enhanced, [[haemoglobin]] rises, buffers in the bloodstream increase, [[venous return]] is improved, stroke volume is improved, and the blood bed becomes more able to adapt readily to varying demands. Each of these results of cardiovascular fitness/cardiorespiratory conditioning will have a direct positive effect on [[muscular endurance]], and an indirect effect on [[Physical strength|strength]] and [[flexibility]].

To facilitate optimal delivery of oxygen to the working muscles, an individual needs to train or participate in activities that will build up the energy stores needed for sport. This is referred to as metabolic training. Metabolic training is generally divided into two types: [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]]. A 2005 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane review]] demonstrated that physical activity interventions are effective for increasing cardiovascular fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hillsdon|first=M.|last2=Foster|first2=C.|last3=Thorogood|first3=M.|date=2005-01-25|title=Interventions for promoting physical activity|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=1|pages=CD003180|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003180.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmc=4164373|pmid=15674903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''eccentric contraction''' is the motion of an active muscle while it is lengthening under load. '''Eccentric training''' is repetitively doing eccentric muscle contractions. For example, in a [[biceps curl]] the action of lowering the [[dumbbell]] back down from the lift is the eccentric phase of that exercise — as long as the dumbbell is lowered slowly rather than letting it drop (i.e., the biceps are in a state of contraction to control the rate of descent of the dumbbell).

An eccentric contraction is one of the distinct phases in the movement of [[muscle]]s and [[tendon]]s; they include [[isometric contraction]] (no movement), [[isotonic contraction]] and [[concentric contraction]] (shortening).

Eccentric training focuses on slowing down the elongation of the [[muscle process]] in order to challenge the muscles, which can lead to stronger muscles, faster [[muscle repair]] and increasing [[metabolic rate]].&lt;ref name=bubb&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bubbico | first1 = Aaron | last2 = Kravitz | first2 = Len | last3 = Ph | year = 2010 | title = Eccentric Training | url = http://www.ideafit.com/fitness-library/eccentricexercise | journal = IDEA Fitness Journal | volume = 7 | page = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eccentric movement provides a braking mechanism for muscle and tendon groups that are experiencing concentric movement to protect [[joint]]s from damage as the contraction is released.&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;

Eccentric training is particularly good for casual and high performance [[sportsperson|athlete]]s or the elderly and patients looking to rehabilitate certain muscles and tendons.&lt;ref name=lind260&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindstedt | first1 = S. L. | last2 = LaStayo | first2 = P.C. | last3 = Reich | first3 = T.E. | last4 = December | year = 2001 | title = When Active Muscles Lengthen: Properties and Consequences of Eccentric Contractions | journal = News Physiol. Sci. | volume = 16 | issue = 6| page = 260 | doi = 10.1152/physiologyonline.2001.16.6.256 | pmid = 11719600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negative movement ==

This movement has also been described as negative training. This "negative" movement is necessary to reverse the muscle from its initial [[trajectory]].&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;

When load exceeds the force that can be developed by the muscle at constant length, as in an eccentric [[muscle action]], the exercise is referred to as involving negative work, because the muscle is absorbing energy.&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;

Eccentric contractions use less metabolic energy, even though they can create more force than concentric actions.&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;

== History ==

[[Adolf Fick]] originally discovered in 1882 that "contracting muscle under stretch could produce greater force than a shortening muscle contraction" like in concentric movements. Fifty years later, [[A.V. Hill]] determined that "the body had lower [[energy demand]] during an eccentric muscle contraction than during a concentric muscle action".&lt;ref name=lind256&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lindstedt | first1 = S. L. | last2 = LaStayo | first2 = P.C. | last3 = Reich | first3 = T.E. | last4 = December | year = 2001 | title = When Active Muscles Lengthen: Properties and Consequences of Eccentric Contractions | journal = News Physiol. Sci. | volume = 16 | issue = 6| pages = 256–61 | doi = 10.1152/physiologyonline.2001.16.6.256 | pmid = 11719600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erling Asmussen]] first introduced eccentric training in 1953 as "excentric", with ex meaning "away from" and centric meaning "center". Hence, the term was coined to mean a [[muscle contraction]] that moves away from the center of the muscle.&lt;ref name=lind256 /&gt;

But the first revelation of the functional significance of these properties occurred by way of a clever demonstration devised by [[Bud Abbott]], [[Brenda Bigland]], and [[Murdoch Ritchie]]. They connected two stationary cycle [[Exercise machine|ergometers]] back-to-back with a single chain, such that one cyclist pedaled forward and the other resisted this forward motion by braking the backward-moving pedals. Because the [[internal resistance]] of the device was low, the same force was being applied by both individuals, yet the task was much easier for the individual braking. This demonstration cleverly revealed that a tiny female resisting the movement of the pedals could easily exert more force than, and hence control the [[power output]] of, a large burly male pedaling forward.&lt;ref name=lind256 /&gt;

== Energy ==

During the eccentric phase of movement, the muscle absorbs energy. This work is done "by stretching the muscle and in this process the muscle absorbs [[mechanical energy]]".&lt;ref name=lind256 /&gt;

This mechanical energy is dissipated or converted into one or a combination of two energies. 
* Heat
* Elastic recoil

=== Heat ===
The energy that is absorbed by the muscle will be dissipated as heat if the muscle is being used as a "[[wikt:damper|damper]] or [[shock absorber]]". This leads to increase in [[body temperature]].&lt;ref name=lind256 /&gt;

=== Elastic recoil ===
The energy that is absorbed by the muscle can be converted into [[elastic recoil energy]], and can be recovered and reused by the body. This creates more efficiency because the body is able to use the energy for the next movement, decreasing the initial impact or shock of the movement.&lt;ref name=lind256 /&gt;

For example, [[kinetic energy]] is absorbed in running every time one's foot strikes the ground and continues as one's mass overtakes the foot. At this moment, elastic recoil energy is at its maximum and a large amount of this energy is absorbed and is added to the next stride.&lt;ref name=lind256 /&gt;

This movement is similar to the action of [[spring (device)|springs]], where the muscle is continually shortened and stretched resulting in enhanced effectiveness and force. It can lead to the perception of "less effort" even though dealing with higher force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = LaStayo | first1 = Paul C. | last2 = Ewy | first2 = Gordon A. | last3 = Pierotti | first3 = David D. | last4 = Johns | first4 = Richard K. | last5 = Lindstedt | first5 = Stan | last6 = May | year = 2003 | title = The positive effects of negative work: increased muscle strength and decreased fall risk in a frail elderly population | journal = Journal of Gerontology | volume = 58A | issue = 5| pages = M419-24 | doi = 10.1093/gerona/58.5.m419 | pmid = 12730250 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But time matters in elastic recoil. If this energy is not used quickly it is dissipated as [[heat]]. The role of eccentric training is to use these principles of [[energy conversion]] to strengthen muscle and tendon groups.&lt;ref name=lind256 /&gt;

== Physiological mechanisms ==
The muscle has "tension producing tissue comprising small contractile units referred to as [[sarcomere]]s" that each contain a "thick ([[myosin]]) and thin ([[actin]]) [[myofilament]] (muscle filaments or proteins) that overlaps to format a cross-bridge bond (attachment)".&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;

When in a concentric exercise, shortening of a muscle occurs as the myosin and actin cross bridges repeatedly attach and detach to draw the actin across the myosin — creating force. Each cross-bridge attachment and detachment cycle is powered by the splitting of one molecule of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). Examples of such exercises include kicking a ball or lifting a weight.&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;

In controlled release reversals of such concentric motions, the eccentric movement stretches the muscle with [[opposing force]] that is stronger than the muscle force. When myofilaments of the muscle fiber are stretched in such eccentric contractions there can be reduced numbers of detachments of [[cross bridge]] myosin and actin links. With more cross bridges remaining attached there is greater force production in the muscle. Examples of activities involving eccentric muscle contraction include walking down a hill or resisting the force of gravity while lowering a heavy object.&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;

"Eccentric actions place a stretch on the sarcomeres to the point where the myofilaments may experience strain, otherwise known as exercise induced [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] (DOMS)" (Aaron Bubbico &amp; Len Kravitz, 2010). One area of research that has much promise in relation to DOMS and eccentric exercise is the [[repeated-bout effect]] (RBE). To help prevent or lessen DOMS from eccentric exercise, or to facilitate recovery from it, the exerciser would eccentrically stimulate the muscle then repeat at weekly intervals to build up strength and allow the strain (in response to a given force level) to reduce over time.&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;

== Muscle injury ==
Eccentric contractions are a frequent cause of muscle injury when engaging in unaccustomed exercise. But a single bout of such eccentric exercise leads to adaptation which will make the muscle less vulnerable to injury on subsequent performance of the eccentric exercise.&lt;ref name="pmid12409811"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Clarkson PM1, Hubal MJ | title=Exercise-induced muscle damage in humans | journal=American Journal of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation | volume=81 | issue=11&amp;nbsp;Suppl | year=2002 | pages=S52–S69 | pmid=12409811 | doi=10.1097/00002060-200211001-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Findings ==
Several key findings have been researched regarding the benefits of eccentric training:

*Eccentric training creates greater force owing to the "decreased rate of cross-bridge muscle detachments." [[Patient]]s and athletes will have more muscle force for bigger weights when eccentric training.&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;
*Eccentric contractions use less energy and actually absorb energy that will be used as heat or elastic recoil for the next movement.&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;
*Increased [[Delayed onset muscle soreness|DOMS]] leads to more tenderness in eccentric, rather than pure [[pain]] or tendon [[swelling (medical)|swelling]] amongst patients.&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;
*Repeated-bout Effect markedly reduces [[Delayed onset muscle soreness|DOMS]]. "Completing bouts of eccentric training and then repeating the workout 1 week (or more) later will result in less DOMS after the second workout."&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;
*Older individuals are less vulnerable to [[injury]] from eccentric exercise, primarily because of the reduced strain on muscle-tendon groupings as compared to traditional concentric exercise.&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;
*Stretching of the muscles and eccentric training provides protection from injury or re-injury.&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;
*Eccentric training has proven to be an excellent post [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] intervention for lower-body injuries.&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;
*Subjects report less weariness from eccentric training than from concentric training.&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;
*Total body eccentric training can raise resting metabolic rate by about 9 percent, with the greatest magnitude in the first two hours.&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;
*While energy costs remain low, the degree of force is very high. This leads to muscles that respond with significant increases in muscle strength, size and power.&lt;ref name=bubb /&gt;

==Eccentric exercise==
Eccentric exercise or resistance training is currently being used as a form of rehabilitation for sport injuries, but also as an alternative form of exercise for the elderly, those affected by neurological disorders, COPD, cardiopulmonary disorders, and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = LaStayo, P.C. | title = The positive effects of negative work| journal = Gerontology| volume = 5 | year = 2003 | pages = M419–M424|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muscle loss is a big problem faced by the people afflicted with the above disorders and many cannot participate in rigorous exercise protocols. Eccentric muscle contractions produce high forces with low-energy cost. According to Hortobágyi due to these properties eccentric exercise has the greatest potential for muscle strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hortobágyi, T. | title = Adaptive responses to muscle lengthening and shortening in humans | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology| volume = 80 | issue = 3 |      year = 1996 | pages = 765–772|display-authors=etal| doi = 10.1152/jappl.1996.80.3.765 | pmid = 8964735 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To strengthen muscle the external force must exceed the muscle while it lengthens.&lt;ref name="Lepley, L.K. 2013 150"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lepley, L.K. | s2cid = 22428839 | title = Effect of Eccentric Strengthening After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction on Quadriceps Strength | journal = Sport Rehabilitation| volume = 22 | issue = 2 |      year = 2013 | pages = 150–156| doi = 10.1123/jsr.22.2.150 | pmid = 23238230 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of [[eccentric contraction]] is almost the exact definition of muscle strengthening.

'''Perceived muscle damage:'''
There is a stipulation regarding eccentric contractions in that they actually cause muscle damage and injury. Eccentric contraction may result in delayed onset muscle soreness however; the contraction itself does not cause muscle damage or injury.&lt;ref name="Lindstedt, S. n.d. 256–261"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lindstedt, S. | title = When active muscles lengthen: Properties and consequences of eccentric contractions | journal = News in Physiological Sciences| volume = 16 |      year = n.d. | issue = 6 | pages = 256–261| doi = 10.1152/physiologyonline.2001.16.6.256 | pmid = 11719600 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof of muscle strengthening without damage:'''
One recurring problem in [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] rehabilitation is improving muscle strength of the quadriceps without re-injury. Early, high-force eccentric training can be used to increase muscle strength and volume without damage to the ACL graft, surrounding soft-tissue, and the articular cartilage.&lt;ref name="Lepley, L.K. 2013 150"/&gt; In an experiment performed on rat muscles after twenty sessions of treadmill low intensity eccentric training the wet weight of the muscles and the fiber cross-section were significantly larger than the control and level groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wakako, T. | title = Induction of Muscle Hypertrophy in Rats through Low Intensity Eccentric Contraction | journal =  Journal of Physical Therapy Science| volume = 26 | issue = 10 |      year = 2014 | pages = 1623–1625|display-authors=etal| doi = 10.1589/jpts.26.1623 | pmid = 25364129 | pmc = 4210414 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These results led to the conclusion that low intensity eccentric contractions have the ability to "produce enough mechanical stress to induce [[muscle hypertrophy]] without over-stressing which could produce muscle fiber damage. Other articles have found that muscle damage is not required to reach hypertrophy. Greater mechanical stress brought on by eccentric contractions is what leads to hypertrophy in individuals undergoing eccentric training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schoenfeld, B.J. | s2cid = 28174205 | title = Does Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage Play a Role in Skeletal Muscle Hypertrophy? | journal = Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research| volume = 26 | issue = 5 |      year = 2012 | pages = 1441–1453 | doi=10.1519/jsc.0b013e31824f207e| pmid = 22344059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies done on the elderly show that low-intensity eccentric conditioning can actually minimize muscle damage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chen, T.C. | s2cid = 1087978 | title = Low-intensity eccentric contractions attenuate muscle damage induced by subsequent maximal eccentric exercise of the knee extensors in the elderly | journal = European Journal of Applied Physiology| volume = 113 | issue = 4 | year = 2013 | pages = 1005–1015 | doi=10.1007/s00421-012-2517-3| pmid = 23064871 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gault the low cost of energy, and low oxygen demand make low-intensity eccentric exercise ideal for the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gault, M.L. | s2cid = 15904074 | title = Functional mobility of older adults after concentric and eccentric endurance exhercise | journal = Applied Physiology | volume = 112 | issue = 11 |      year = 2012 | pages = 3699–3707 | doi=10.1007/s00421-012-2338-4| pmid = 22350353 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eccentric contraction and oxygen consumption:'''
Oxygen consumption is needed for muscles to work properly. Eccentric muscle contractions are considered to be negative work as the muscle is working with resistance. Negative work is the mechanical energy absorbed by the work conducted on a muscle when the force on the muscle is greater than the force produced.&lt;ref name="Lindstedt, S. n.d. 256–261"/&gt; An experiment was conducted on bicycle riding. The amount of oxygen consumption was measured during the motion of pedaling forward as positive work and pedaling with resistance as negative work.&lt;ref name="Abbott, B. 1952 380–390"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Abbott, B. | title = The physiological cost of negative work | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 117 | issue = 3 |      year = 1952 | pages = 380–390 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004755| pmid = 14946742 | pmc = 1392548 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Less oxygen was consumed during negative work then that of positive work with the oxygen consumption ratio being 3:7.&lt;ref name="Abbott, B. 1952 380–390"/&gt; 
Due to the low oxygen consumption of eccentric exercise studies have been conducted on patients with severe COPD. An eccentric cycling exercise workout was created for these patients and the results found there to be no side effects, minimal muscle soreness that had no effect on power, and a high compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vieira, D. | s2cid = 12268422 | title = Eccentric Cycle Exercise in Severe COPD: Feasibility of Application | journal = COPD: Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease | volume = 8| issue = 4 |      year = 2011| pages = 270–274 | doi=10.3109/15412555.2011.579926| pmid = 21728805 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, other cycling studies concluded that eccentric cycling was a safe alternative for COPD patients as they can perform high intensity work with lower cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rooyackers, J. | title = Eccentric exercise training in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  | journal = Rehabilitation Research| volume = 26 | issue = 1 |      year = 2003| pages = 47–49 | doi=10.1097/00004356-200303000-00006| pmid = 12601267 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eccentric contractions and cardiac output:'''
With lower cost of oxygen how would eccentric exercise affect the heart?
A study was performed to test how eccentric and concentric contractions effect cardiac autonomic modulation after exercise. Men (aged 18–30) were divided into four groups: concentric control, eccentric control, concentric training, and eccentric training. Results concluded that resistance training (eccentric contractions) promoted strength gain. An increase in cardiac vagal modulation during recovery was also concluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gois, M.0. | title = The influence of resistance exercise with emphasis on specific contractions (concentric vs. eccentric) on muscle strength and post-exercise autonomic modulation: a randomized clinical trial. | journal = Brazilian Journal of Physical Therapy| volume = 18 | issue = 1 |      year = 2014 | pages = 30–37 | doi=10.1590/s1413-35552012005000141| pmid = 24675910 | pmc = 4183241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lot of studies have been conducted regarding eccentric exercise over the last decade. It can be said there is substantial evidence that eccentric exercise truly exceeds concentric exercise for rehabilitation and training aspects in force, energy cost, oxygen consumption, and muscular strengthening.

== Sports and rehabilitation ==
[[File:Kim St-Pierre 33.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.6|alt=Woman wearing red hockey uniform and face mask|[[Kim St-Pierre]] healed from hip surgery with eccentric exercise]]
With eccentric training, muscles are able to create more for less work, which has special meaning in the realms of high performance sports — both for [[injury prevention]] and optimal-performance training. For athletes and sports enthusiasts, this eccentric model can help with [[explosive force]]{{cn|date=August 2020}} training in order to prevent injuries or recurring injuries, and trains the body to use the kinetic force driven by eccentric training more efficiently.&lt;ref name="Paul C 2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = LaStayo | first1 = Paul C.

The Esmonde Technique takes eccentric training and makes it available to the masses through ''Classical Stretch'' and ''Essentrics''. After having hip surgery in the summer of 2007, St-Pierre began to practice the Esmonde Technique with experts [[Miranda Esmonde-White]] from PBS’s ''Classical Stretch'' and Sahra Esmonde-White host of the ''Essentrics'' workout in order to heal her hip.&lt;ref name=ctvolympics.ca&gt;{{cite news|title=Goalie St.Pierre Takes A Page From The Ballet World|url=https://www.tsn.ca/mma/story/?id=275470|newspaper=TSN|date=April 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to tests, increases in both strength and muscle fiber are higher in eccentric training than in traditional concentric training.&lt;ref&gt;Roig, M., O’Brien, K., Kirk, G., Murray, R., McKinnon, P., Shadgan, B., Reid, W.D., 2009, "The effects of eccentric versus concentric resistance training on muscle strength and mass in healthy adults: a systematic review with meta-analysis", British Journal of Sports Medicine, Volume 43, pp. 556-568.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rehabilitative nature, low energy costs, high magnitudes of force, and low uptake of [[oxygen]] all align eccentric exercise for both the elderly and rehabilitative functions.&lt;ref name=lind260 /&gt;

In old age, loss of strength and [[muscle mass]] is commonplace. Add to these factors [[disease]] and [[Cardiac disease|cardiac]] and [[respiratory illness]]. Eccentric training enables the elderly, and those with the same problems, the ability to train muscle groups and increase strength and resiliency with low-energy exercise.&lt;ref name=lind260 /&gt;

Eccentric training has been found to be beneficial to those with a variety of physical [[ailment]]s.&lt;ref name="Paul C 2003"/&gt;

According to one systematic review and meta-analysis on [[shoulder impingement syndrome]], eccentric training didn't improve pain or function more than other types of training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Larsson|first1=Robin|last2=Bernhardsson|first2=Susanne|last3=Nordeman|first3=Lena|date=2019|title=Effects of eccentric exercise in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=446|doi=10.1186/s12891-019-2796-5|pmid=31610787|pmc=6792214|issn=1471-2474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anterior cruciate ligament damage ==
Tearing an [[anterior cruciate ligament]] (ACL) in the knee causes serious damage that can last several years and often requires surgery. The ACL is one of the four main stabilizing [[ligament]]s of the knee. During the post-operative rehabilitation of patients, eccentric training can be used as a cornerstone of developing muscle size and strength. According to tests conducted by J. Parry Gerber in 2007, structural changes in the muscles greatly exceeded those achieved with standard concentric rehabilitation. The success of the involvement of gradual progressive exposure to negative work ultimately led to the production of high muscle force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerber | first1 = Marcus | last2 = Parry | first2 = J. | last3 = Robin | first3 = L. | last4 = Dibble | first4 = Leland E. | last5 = Greis | first5 = Patrick E. | last6 = Burks | first6 = Robert T. | last7 = LaStayo | first7 = Paul C. | last8 = March | year = 2007 | title = After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Effects of Early Progressive Eccentric Exercise on Muscle Structure | journal = The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery | volume = 89 | issue = 3| pages = 559–57 | doi=10.2106/jbjs.f.00385| pmid = 17332105 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sarcopenia ==
[[Sarcopenia]] is the progressive loss of muscle mass due to aging. Muscle mass begins to deteriorate as early as the age of 25, and consistently deteriorates into old age. By the age of 80 "one half of the skeletal muscle has been lost" (Lastayo, Woolf, Lewek, Snyder-Mackler, Reich &amp; Lindstedt, 2003). With this great decrease in mass, strength is also decreased. Eccentric training has the ability to counteract sarcopenia through sustained training.  The unique trait of greater overloads to the muscle with less strenuous impact on the body, as well as [[cardiac]] and [[respiratory]] systems, offers a unique case for the elderly. The high-force and low-cost set of attributes in eccentric exercise makes it ideal for the actively impaired.&lt;ref name="LaStayo, Paul C 2003, p. 562"/&gt;

== Muscle tendon injuries ==
The entire [[muscle-tendon system]] works cohesively to slow down [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] movement. The close relationship between the muscle and tendons help to dissipate heat or temporarily store kinetic energy. If the forces needed to slow down a limb exceed the capacity of the muscle-tendon system, injury is likely to occur.

Athletes with recurring [[hamstring]] and [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abductor muscle]] injuries have greater impairment of eccentric strength, suggesting that improvements in eccentric training may minimize the risks of injury by strengthening the muscle-tendon groupings in high-stress areas of the body.

Eccentric training is of huge benefit to those that wish to avert injuries by improving the muscles abilities to absorb more energy before deteriorating. According to one article, "Increased stiffness in tendons, greater force at failure, and an improved ability to absorb energy at the musculotendonous junction result following eccentric exercise training".&lt;ref name="LaStayo, Paul C 2003, p. 562"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = LaStayo | first1 = Paul C. Ph.D | last2 = Woolf | first2 = John M. | last3 = Lewek | first3 = Michael D. | last4 = Snyder-Mackler | first4 = Lynn | last5 = Trude-Reich | first5 = Lindstedt | last6 = Stan | first6 = L. Ph.D | last7 = October | year = 2003 | title = Eccentric Muscle Contractions: Their Contribution to Injury, Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Sport | journal = Journal of Orthopaedic &amp; Sports Physical Therapy | volume = 33 | issue = 10| pages = 557–71 | doi = 10.2519/jospt.2003.33.10.557 | pmid = 14620785 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Osteopenia ==
Usually viewed as a precursor to [[osteoporosis]], [[osteopenia]] is when [[bone density]] is lower than normal levels. Bone mass is affected by muscles forces and their loads to the bone structure. The strength and density of the bone is directly influenced by local strain. Due to the high strain on muscles during eccentric training, coupled with low energy output, eccentric training becomes a cornerstone of the rehabilitative process.&lt;ref name="LaStayo, Paul C 2003, p. 562"/&gt;

== Tendinoses ==
Intense repetitive activities tend to create [[Tendinosis|chronic tendon disorders]], where the tendons become injured, inflamed or ruptured. While typically these disorders are directly related to eccentric muscle movements, the ability for a muscle to strengthen and prevent injury through eccentric training is great. Controlled rehabilitative regimes will actually strengthen and repair tendons. Ample evidence supports the notion that the tendon, like the muscle, can adapt favorably to [[physical stress]] and eccentric loads.&lt;ref name="LaStayo, Paul C 2003, p. 562"/&gt;

It has been deduced that high muscle tendon forces delivered in a controlled environment are needed for optimal tendon adaptation. While eccentric stress is related to the injury, high force eccentric exercises are needed to maximize recovery.&lt;ref name="LaStayo, Paul C 2003, p. 562"/&gt;

== Chronic patellar tendonitis ==
A condition that arises when the tendon and the tissues that surround it, become inflamed and irritated. This is usually due to overuse, especially from jumping activities. This is the reason [[chronic patellar tendonitis]] is often called "jumper’s knee." A study done by [[Roald Bahr]] and colleagues looked at which method of tendon rehabilitation exercise — the "eccentric squat" exercise or the universal gym "leg extension/leg curl" — produced more recovery results in terms of recovery in the treatment of chronic patellar tendonitis. On the twelve-week exercise program, participants were tested for thigh circumference and quadriceps and hamstring [[moment of force]]. There was no significant difference between the groups in either [[quadriceps]] or hamstring moment of force and hamstring moment of force significantly increased in both groups, but the eccentric squat saw significantly lower pain ratings and produced twice as many "pain free" subjects at the end of the program than the other group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bahr | first1 = Roald | last2 = Fossan | first2 = Bjorn | last3 = Loken | first3 = Sverre | last4 = Engebretsen | first4 = Lars | last5 = August | s2cid = 10659933 | year = 2006 | title = Surgical Treatment Compared with Eccentric Training for Patellar Tendinopathy (Jumpers Knee) A Randomized Controlled Trial | journal = The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery | volume = 88A | issue = 8| pages = 1689–1698 | doi = 10.2106/JBJS.E.01181 | pmid = 16882889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cardiovascular changes ==
Several recent studies have indicated that eccentric exercise as in walking down hill has greater beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles and physical fitness than walking up hill.  One study used stairs and elevators

[[Image:Stride-q210c.jpg|thumb|right|An elliptical machine, a type of exercise machine]]
An '''exercise machine''' is any [[machine]] used for physical [[exercise]]. These range from simple spring-like devices to computerized electromechanical rides to recirculating-stream swimming pools. Most exercise machines incorporate an ergometer. An '''ergometer''' is an apparatus for measuring the [[mechanical work|work]] a person exerts while exercising as used in training or [[cardiac stress tests]] or other medical tests.

==Resistance machines==
=== Weight machines ===
{{Main|Weight machine}}
Weight machines use gravity as the primary source of resistance, and a combination of [[simple machine]]s to convey that resistance, to the person using the machine. Each of the simple machines (pulley, lever, wheel, incline) changes the [[mechanical advantage]] of the overall machine relative to the weight.

===Other kinds of resistance machines===
*kBox
* [[Friction]] machines
* [[Spring (device)|Spring]]-loaded machines (such as [[Bowflex]])
* Fan-loaded machines
* Fluid-loaded machines
* [[Bullworker]]
* Hydraulic equipment
* [[Whole body vibration]]
* [[Outdoor gym]]
* [[Pneumatic exercise equipment]]
* [[Soloflex]]
* [[treadmill]]
* [[Precor StretchTrainer|StretchTrainer]]

==Endless-path machines==

===Stationary bicycles===
* [[Exercise bicycle]]

===Running/walking machines===
*[[Treadmill]]
*[[Elliptical trainer]]

===Elliptical machines===
Ellipticals (elliptical machines) are a combination of stair-climbing and a treadmill. Generally it contains two tracks upon which the user stands. Users describe an elliptical motion (hence the machine name) while walking or jogging. Some ellipticals have magnetic resistance controls that add difficulty to doing the motion.

===Glider machines===
This machine allows the user to stand on two separate foot pedals and use their own muscles to create the movement. The stabilized movement can be likened to that of a "swing set" for each leg.

===Climbing machines===
Also named stair-climbing machines, they work the user's legs as he/she pumps pedals up and down, much like climbing stairs. Some climbing machines have handles to push and pull to exercise the whole body.
&lt;!--===Skiing machines===---&gt;

===Rowing machines===
[[Indoor rower|Rowing machines]], also named rowers, simulate the body movements of using a rowing boat.

===Skiing machines===

      <text bytes="4035" xml:space="preserve">The term '''suspension training''' refers to an approach to [[strength training]] that uses a system of ropes and webbing called a "suspension trainer" to allow users to work against their own body weight.

[[File:Workout im freien mit einem Sling Trainer.jpg|thumb|outdoor workout with a Sling Trainer]]

==Description==
[[Image:Group Personal Training at a Gym.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Group suspension training.]]
The field of suspension training is a form of [[Strength training|resistance training]] that includes [[bodyweight exercise]]s in which a variety of multi-planar, compound exercise movements can be performed. These are done with the aim of developing strength, balance, flexibility, and joint stability simultaneously.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; Suspension training develops physical strength while using functional movements and dynamic positions. The actual term "suspension training" is a trademark of Fitness Anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;[https://trademarks.justia.com/787/87/suspension-training-78787949.html  Suspension Training]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Rope training has been around as early as the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=afl3769.0001.001;page=root;view=image;size=s;seq=7;frm=frameset; Illustrations from 1866 book "Athletic Sports for Boys"], pp. 43-50&lt;/ref&gt;

Randy Hetrick, a former [[Navy Seal]] and [[Stanford]] [[MBA]] graduate, developed the Total Resistance eXercise (TRX) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ymcaoc.org/downloads/branches/fn_2012_jan_trx.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; equipment and the associated Suspension Training bodyweight exercises in the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Dolby|title=Randy Hetrick – Inventor Of The TRX|url=http://efm.net.au/randy-hetrick-inventor-of-the-trx/|website=http://efm.net.au/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started marketing it in 2005.  Kurt Dasbach, a former professional soccer player in Chile, discovered an ancient Andean conditioning system that utilized ropes{{primary source inline|date=April 2012}} while playing in South America and developed a rival product, Inkaflexx, around the same time.  Inkaflexx has since closed shop, but TRX continues as a $60 million per year business.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.menshealth.com/fitness/randy-hetrick-trx; "Men's Health - "Meet the Mastermind Behind One of Your Favorite Pieces of Equipment"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, ex [[Bristol City F.C.]] fitness coaching team Mark Hammond and Pete Faulkner developed the FKPro two-strap system. In 2009 Fabio Martella MMA coaching wrote the first TRX technical manual in Italy.  Another alternative is the aeroSling ELITE made in Germany. This "Suspended Pulley Trainer" also contains a pulley system.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; The Hook Isometrics/Suspension Trainer by Sierra Exercise Equipment enables the user to use it for either suspension training or isometrics training.  Evolution has continued with TRX and other companies improving designs to minimize risk.

==Benefits and criticism==
Proponents of suspension training argue that it develops core body strength, as well as joint and muscular stability, reducing the chance of injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/articles/2008/07/17/they_get_a_lift_from_their_workouts/ They get a lift from their workouts] - ''Boston Globe''. Retrieved on 2009-06-08&lt;/ref&gt; Some sports scientists have expressed concern that weaker individuals may not have the core stability or joint integrity to use the system safely and effectively.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

'''Toning exercises''' are [[physical exercises]] that are used with the aim of developing a [[physical attractiveness|physique]] with a large emphasis on [[musculature]]. In this context, the term '''toned''' implies leanness in the body (low levels of [[body fat]]), noticeable muscle definition and shape, but not significant muscle size ("bulk").

Research and basic anatomical knowledge imply that the notion of specific exercises to improve tone is unfounded. Exercises can aid fat loss or stimulate [[muscle hypertrophy]], but cannot otherwise improve tone.&lt;ref name="waehner"&gt;Waehner, Paige. [http://exercise.about.com/cs/weightloss/a/toning.htm Can You Really 'Tone' Your Body?]&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the muscle can change, as can the amount of fat covering the muscle, but the 'shape' cannot.

The words "tone" and "toning" can be misleading as they suggests that [[spot reduction]] is possible, which it is not. More accurate descriptions are "muscle building" and "fat loss."

== Exercises ==
Exercises popularly believed to improve tone are primarily [[Weight training|weight lifting]] exercises performed with high repetitions and low resistance (low weight), with short rest periods.

This [[conventional wisdom]] is however criticized as poor-quality and inefficient.&lt;ref name="waehner" /&gt; What is advocated is an exercise routine involving;

* [[Strength training|resistance training]] - to stimulate muscle breakdown and repair (increasing muscle mass will raise metabolism, as muscle has a higher calorific usage than fat&lt;ref name="waehner" /&gt;);
* [[cardiovascular exercise]] (particularly interval training) to burn calories;
* optimal nutrition - to manipulate calorie intake and provide sufficient nutrition for muscle growth. The primary requirement for looking toned is obtaining low body fat, as it is fat that creates a 'soft' look.&lt;ref name="waehner" /&gt;

==See also==
* [[Spot reduction]], the fallacy that [[Adipose tissue|fat]] can be targeted for reduction from a specific area of the body

'''Steve Pulcinella''' (born October 19, 1965) is an American former [[Powerlifting|powerlifter]], [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]], and [[Highland games]] competitor. He is the owner of Iron Sport Gym in [[Glenolden, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://articles.philly.com/2002-05-11/sports/25347880_1_strongman-tires-world-s-strongest-man | title=Archives &amp;#124; the Philadelphia Inquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Pulcinella was born and raised in [[Ridley Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Ridley Township, Pennsylvania]], where he began strength training at his high school, [[Ridley High School]] in [[Folsom, Pennsylvania]], with his cousin, bodybuilder Dave Pulcinella. He started training with weights at age 13 and competed in his first powerlifting meet at age 14.&lt;ref name="articles.elitefts"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://articles.elitefts.com/features/interviews/spotlight-new-efs-log-addition-%E2%80%93-strongman-steve-pulcinella/ | title = Spotlight: New EFS Log Addition – Q&amp;A Interview with Strongman Steve Pulcinella | accessdate = 2013-02-01 | last = Nicolay | first = Zach | publisher = EliteFTS | date = 2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from Ridley in 1983, Pulcinella worked at his father's printing shop. Over the next 24 years, he supported his lifting career by doing pre-press work, sales, and customer service for the family business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasgaweb.com/forum/interview-with-steve-pulcinella-2-4-10_topic14521.html | title = Interview with Steve Pulcinella (2/4/10) | accessdate = 2013-02-01 | last = Smith | first = C. | date = 4 Feb 2010 | publisher = North American Scottish Games Athletics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifting career==
Pulcinella began competing in powerlifting in 1981 and quickly earned a reputation for his large size and big lifts. He competed for about eight years, during which time he won four Pennsylvania State Powerlifting Championships, two Pennsylvania State Region II Powerlifting titles, and placed second in the USPF teenage national championships.&lt;ref name="samson-power"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://samson-power.com/ASL/pulcinella.html | title = Steve Pulcinella: Brief Biography | accessdate = 2013-02-01 | last = McShane | first = Justin | date = 31 Jan 1998 | publisher = American Strength Legends}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Pulcinella began training and competing as a professional strongman. In 1993, he won Virginia's Strongest Man and the [[Strength athletics in Canada#North America's Strongest Man|North America's Strongest Man]] competition in [[Toronto]], defeating 15 competitors in events including car deadlift, truck pull, and keg loading.&lt;ref name="samson-power" /&gt; In 1994, Pulcinella was invited to compete in the [[World's Strongest Man]] contest in [[South Africa]], where he placed last in his group and did not qualify for the Finals.

Pulcinella stopped competing in Strongman when he became a Highland Games pro in 1995. At the height of his career, he was competing in over 20 Highland Games events every year.&lt;ref name="articles.elitefts" /&gt; Pulcinella qualified annually for the U.S. National Highland Games contest, participated in more than 300 events around the world, and earned over 40 professional titles over the course of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasgaweb.com/main.asp | title = North American Scottish Games Athletics Database | accessdate = 2013-02-07 | author = NASGA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he won the International Pro Highland Games competition at [[Loon Mountain]] in [[Lincoln, New Hampshire]] against a strong field of top throwers.&lt;ref name="articles.elitefts" /&gt; Pulcinella retired from competing in Highland Games in 2011 after a devastating knee injury at the Newport Oregon Highland Games in [[Newport, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://asp.elitefts.net/qa/training-logs.asp?qid=147900&amp;tid=199 | title = Newport Oregon Highland Games/Tragic Injury | accessdate = 2013-02-01 | last = Pulcinella | first = Steve | date = 15 Jun 2011 | work = EliteFTS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current career==
In 1995, Pulcinella and his brother Joe opened Iron Sport Gym in Glenolden, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ironsport.com/ | title = Iron Sport Gym | accessdate = 2013-02-01 | last = Pulcinella | first = Joe | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulcinella manages and maintains the gym, works with clients, and - though he has retired from competition - still trains to maintain what he calls “recreational hugeness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://asp.elitefts.net/qa/training-logs.asp?qid=149817&amp;tid=199 | title = Todays Delts and Bi's training and some of my goals | accessdate = 2013-02-01 | last = Pulcinella | first = Steve | date = 13 Jul 2011 | work = EliteFTS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of Iron Sport, Pulcinella regularly announces for regional Highland Games competitions, and serves as athletic director for the annual Celtic Classic in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]], which was highlighted in a January 2013 episode of the [[Travel Channel]] series ''[[Edge of America]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Jodi | last = Duckett | title = Celtic Classic, Braveheart Highland Pub to be featured on TV show 'Edge of America' | date = 29 Jan 2013 | url = http://articles.mcall.com/2013-01-29/entertainment/mc-celtic-classic-braveheart-travel-channel-20130128_1_haggis-celtic-classic-steve-pulcinella | work = The Morning Call | accessdate = 2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blogging and writing==

Receptors for myokines are found on muscle, fat, liver, pancreas, bone, heart, immune, and brain cells.&lt;ref name="DelezieHandschin2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delezie|first1=Julien|last2=Handschin|first2=Christoph|title=Endocrine Crosstalk Between Skeletal Muscle and the Brain|journal=Frontiers in Neurology|volume=9|pages=698|year=2018|issn=1664-2295|doi=10.3389/fneur.2018.00698|pmid=30197620|pmc=6117390}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location of these receptors reflects the fact that myokines have multiple functions. Foremost, they are involved in exercise-associated metabolic changes, as well as in the metabolic changes following training adaptation.&lt;ref name=pmid17347387 /&gt; They also participate in tissue regeneration and repair, maintenance of healthy bodily functioning, [[Homeostasis|immunomodulation]]; and cell signaling, expression and differentiation.&lt;ref name=pmid17347387 /&gt;

==History==

The definition and use of the term myokine first occurred in 2003.&lt;ref name=pmid14609022&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pedersen BK, Steensberg A, Fischer C, Keller C, Keller P, Plomgaard P, Febbraio M, Saltin B | title = Searching for the exercise factor: is IL-6 a candidate? | journal = Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility | volume = 24 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 113–9 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14609022 | doi = 10.1023/A:1026070911202 | s2cid = 27571687 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, the first myokine, [[myostatin]], was identified.&lt;ref name=pmid23897689/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen DL, Cleary AS, Speaker KJ, Lindsay SF, Uyenishi J, Reed JM, Madden MC, Mehan RS | title = Myostatin, activin receptor IIb, and follistatin-like-3 gene expression are altered in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of obese mice | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

==Functions==
===In repetitive skeletal muscle contractions===
There is an emerging understanding of skeletal muscle as a secretory organ, and of myokines as mediators of [[physical fitness]] through the practice of regular [[physical exercise]] ([[aerobic exercise]] and [[strength training]]), as well as new awareness of the [[anti-inflammatory]] and thus [[disease prevention]] aspects of exercise. Different muscle fiber types – [[slow twitch muscle fibers]], [[oxidative muscle fibers]], [[intermediate twitch muscle fibers]], and [[fast twitch muscle fibers]] – release different clusters of myokines during contraction{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}. This implies that variation of exercise types, particularly [[aerobic training]]/[[endurance training]] and muscle contraction against resistance ([[strength training]]) may offer differing myokine-induced benefits.&lt;ref name="pmid24996176"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanzleiter T, Rath M, Görgens SW, Jensen J, Tangen DS, Kolnes AJ, Kolnes KJ, Lee S, Eckel J, Schürmann A, Eckardt K | title = The myokine decorin is regulated by contraction and involved in muscle hypertrophy | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 450 | issue = 2 | pages = 1089–94 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24996176 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.06.123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Some myokines exert their effects within the muscle itself. Thus, [[myostatin]], [[leukemia inhibitory factor|LIF]], IL-6 and [[interleukin-7|IL-7]] are involved in muscle [[hypertrophy]] and [[myogenesis]], whereas [[BDNF]] and IL-6 are involved in AMPK-mediated fat oxidation. IL-6 also appears to have systemic effects on the liver, adipose tissue and the immune system, and mediates crosstalk between [[enteroendocrine cell|intestinal L cells]] and pancreatic islets. Other myokines include the [[osteogenic]] factors [[IGF-1]] and [[FGF-2]]; [[FSTL1|FSTL-1]], which improves the endothelial function of the vascular system; and the [[PPARGC1A|PGC-1alpha]]-dependent myokine irisin, which drives [[brown fat]]-like development. Studies in the past few years suggest the existence of yet unidentified factors, secreted from muscle cells, which may influence cancer cell growth and pancreas function. Many proteins produced by skeletal muscle are dependent upon contraction; therefore, physical inactivity probably leads to an altered myokine response, which could provide a potential mechanism for the association between sedentary behaviour and many chronic diseases."&lt;ref name=pmid22473333/&gt;

===In brain functions related to neuroplasticity, memory, sleep and mood===
Physical exercise rapidly triggers substantial changes at the organismal level, including the secretion of myokines and metabolites by muscle cells.&lt;ref name="DelezieHandschin2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delezie|first1=Julien|last2=Handschin|first2=Christoph|title=Endocrine Crosstalk Between Skeletal Muscle and the Brain|journal=Frontiers in Neurology|volume=9|pages=698|year=2018|issn=1664-2295|doi=10.3389/fneur.2018.00698|pmid=30197620|pmc=6117390}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, aerobic exercise in humans leads to significant structural alterations in the brain, while wheel-running in rodents promotes neurogenesis and improves synaptic transmission in particular in the hippocampus. Moreover, physical exercise triggers histone modifications and protein synthesis which ultimately positively influence mood and cognitive abilities.&lt;ref name="Gomez-PinillaZhuang2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gomez-Pinilla|first1=F.|last2=Zhuang|first2=Y.|last3=Feng|first3=J.|last4=Ying|first4=Z.|last5=Fan|first5=G.|title=Exercise impacts brain-derived neurotrophic factor plasticity by engaging mechanisms of epigenetic regulation|journal=European Journal of Neuroscience|volume=33|issue=3|year=2011|pages=383–390|issn=0953816X|doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2010.07508.x|pmid=21198979|pmc=3256007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, regular exercise is somewhat associated with a better sleep quality,&lt;ref name="Kline2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kline|first1=Christopher E.|title=The Bidirectional Relationship Between Exercise and Sleep|journal=American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine|volume=8|issue=6|year=2014|pages=375–379|issn=1559-8276|doi=10.1177/1559827614544437|pmid=25729341|pmc=4341978}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could be mediated by the muscle secretome.&lt;ref name="EhlenBrager2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ehlen|first1=J Christopher|last2=Brager|first2=Allison J|last3=Baggs|first3=Julie|last4=Pinckney|first4=Lennisha|last5=Gray|first5=Cloe L|last6=DeBruyne|first6=Jason P|last7=Esser|first7=Karyn A|last8=Takahashi|first8=Joseph S|last9=Paul|first9=Ketema N|title=Bmal1 function in skeletal muscle regulates sleep|journal=eLife|volume=6|year=2017|issn=2050-084X|doi=10.7554/eLife.26557|pmid=28726633|pmc=5574702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In regulating heart architecture===
Heart muscle is subject to two kinds of stress: physiologic stress, i.e. exercise; and pathologic stress, i.e. disease related. Likewise, the heart has two potential responses to either stress: [[cardiac hypertrophy]], which is a normal, physiologic, adaptive growth; or [[cardiac remodeling]], which is an abnormal, pathologic, maladaptive growth. Upon being subjected to either stress, the heart "chooses" to turn on one of the responses and turn off the other. If it has chosen the abnormal path, i.e. remodeling, exercise can reverse this choice by turning off remodeling and turning on hypertrophy. The mechanism for reversing this choice is the [[microRNA]] [[MIR222|miR-222]] in cardiac muscle cells, which exercise up-regulates via unknown myokines. miR-222 represses genes involved in fibrosis and cell-cycle control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hill JA | title = Braking bad hypertrophy | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 372 | issue = 22 | pages = 2160–2 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 26017827 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMcibr1504187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In immunomodulation===
Immunomodulation and immunoregulation were a particular focus of early myokine research, as, according to Dr. Bente Klarlund Pedersen and her colleagues, "the interactions between exercise and the immune system provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the role of underlying endocrine and cytokine mechanisms."&lt;ref name=pmid17347387 /&gt;

Muscle has an impact on the trafficking and inflammation of lymphocytes and neutrophils. During exercise, both [[neutrophils]] and [[NK cells]] and other lymphocytes enter the blood. Long-duration, high-intensity exercise leads to a decrease in the number of lymphocytes, while the concentration of neutrophils increases through mechanisms including adrenaline and [[cortisol]].Interleukin-6 has been shown to mediate the increase in [[Cortisol]]: IL-6 stimulates the production of cortisol and therefore induces [[leukocytosis]] and [[lymphocytopenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2020.567881/full|title=Muscle-Organ Crosstalk: Focus on Immunometabolism|last1=Bay|first1=Marie Lund|last2=Pedersen|first2=Bente Klarlund|date=2020|journal=Frontiers in Physiology|volume=11|page=567881|language=en|issn=1664-042X|doi=10.3389/fphys.2020.567881|pmc=7509178|pmid=33013484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific myokines==

===Myostatin===

Both [[aerobic exercise]] and [[strength training]] (resistance exercise) attenuate [[myostatin]] expression, and myostatin inactivation potentiates the beneficial effects of endurance exercise on metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen DL, Hittel DS, McPherron AC | title = Expression and function of myostatin in obesity, diabetes, and exercise adaptation | journal = Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise | volume = 43 | issue = 10 | pages = 1828–35 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21364474 | pmc = 3192366 | doi = 10.1249/MSS.0b013e3182178bb4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interleukins===
Aerobic [[exercise]] provokes a systemic cytokine response, including, for example, IL-6, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), and IL-10 ([[Interleukin 10]]). IL-6 was serendipitously discovered as a myokine because of the observation that it increased in an exponential fashion proportional to the length of exercise and the amount of muscle mass engaged in the exercise. This increase is followed by the appearance of IL-1ra and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In general, the cytokine response to exercise and sepsis differs with regard to [[TNF-α]]. Thus, the cytokine response to exercise is not preceded by an increase in plasma-TNF-α. Following exercise, the basal plasma IL-6 concentration may increase up to 100-fold, but less dramatic increases are more frequent. The exercise-induced increase of plasma IL-6 occurs in an exponential manner and the peak IL-6 level is reached at the end of the exercise or shortly thereafter. It is the combination of mode, intensity, and duration of the exercise that determines the magnitude of the exercise-induced increase of plasma IL-6.&lt;ref name="Pedersen BK 1406"/&gt;

IL-6 had previously been classified as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Therefore, it was first thought that the exercise-induced IL-6 response was related to muscle damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bruunsgaard H, Galbo H, Halkjaer-Kristensen J, Johansen TL, MacLean DA, Pedersen BK | title = Exercise-induced increase in serum interleukin-6 in humans is related to muscle damage | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 499 ( Pt 3) | issue = 3 | pages = 833–41 | date = March 1997 | pmid = 9130176 | pmc = 1159298 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.1997.sp021972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has become evident that eccentric exercise is not associated with a larger increase in plasma IL-6 than exercise involving concentric “nondamaging” muscle contractions. This finding clearly demonstrates that muscle damage is not required to provoke an increase in plasma IL-6 during exercise. As a matter of fact, eccentric exercise may result in a delayed peak and a much slower decrease of plasma IL-6 during recovery.&lt;ref name=pmid23897689/&gt;

IL-6, among an increasing number of other recently identified myokines, thus remains an important topic of myokine research. It appears in muscle tissue and in the circulation during exercise at levels up to one hundred times basal rates, as noted, and is seen as having a beneficial impact on health and bodily functioning in most circumstances. P. Munoz-Canoves et al. write: "It appears consistently in the literature that IL-6, produced locally by different cell types, has a positive impact on the proliferative capacity of muscle stem cells. This physiological mechanism functions to provide enough muscle progenitors in situations that require a high number of these cells, such as during the processes of muscle regeneration and hypertrophic growth after an acute stimulus. IL-6 is also the founding member of the myokine family of muscle-produced cytokines. Indeed, muscle-produced IL-6 after repeated contractions also has important autocrine and paracrine benefits, acting as a myokine, in regulating energy metabolism, controlling, for example, metabolic functions and stimulating glucose production. It is important to note that these positive effects of IL-6 and other myokines are normally associated with its transient production and short-term action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muñoz-Cánoves P, Scheele C, Pedersen BK, Serrano AL | title = Interleukin-6 myokine signaling in skeletal muscle: a double-edged sword? | journal = The FEBS Journal | volume = 280 | issue = 17 | pages = 4131–48 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23663276 | pmc = 4163639 | doi = 10.1111/febs.12338 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interleukin 15===
[[Interleukin-15]] stimulates fat oxidation, glucose uptake, mitochondrial biogenesis and myogenesis in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. In humans, basal concentrations of IL-15 and its alpha receptor (IL-15Rα) in blood have been inversely associated with physical inactivity and fat mass,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pérez-López|first1=A.|last2=Valadés|first2=D.|last3=Vázquez Martínez|first3=C.|last4=de Cos Blanco|first4=A.

===Brain-derived neurotrophic factor===
{{See also|Neurobiological effects of physical exercise#BDNF signaling}}
[[Brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] ([[BDNF]]) is also a myokine, though BDNF produced by contracting muscle is not released into circulation. Rather, BDNF produced in skeletal muscle appears to enhance the oxidation of fat. Skeletal muscle activation through exercise also contributes to an increase in BDNF secretion in the brain. A beneficial effect of BDNF on neuronal function has been noted in multiple studies.&lt;ref name="Pedersen, Bente Klarlund 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid21282661&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Erickson KI, Voss MW, Prakash RS, Basak C, Szabo A, Chaddock L, Kim JS, Heo S, Alves H, White SM, Wojcicki TR, Mailey E, Vieira VJ, Martin SA, Pence BD, Woods JA, McAuley E, Kramer AF | title = Exercise training increases size of hippocampus and improves memory | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 7 | pages = 3017–22 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21282661 | pmc = 3041121 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1015950108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..108.3017E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Pedersen writes, "[[Neurotrophins]] are a family of structurally related growth factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which exert many of their effects on neurons primarily through Trk receptor tyrosine kinases. Of these, BDNF and its receptor TrkB are most widely and abundantly expressed in the brain. However, recent studies show that BDNF is also expressed in non-neurogenic tissues, including skeletal muscle. BDNF has been shown to regulate neuronal development and to modulate synaptic plasticity. BDNF plays a key role in regulating survival, growth and maintenance of neurons, and BDNF has a bearing on learning and memory. However, BDNF has also been identified as a key component of the hypothalamic pathway that controls body mass and energy homeostasis.

"Most recently, we have shown that BDNF appears to be a major player not only in central metabolic pathways but also as a regulator of metabolism in skeletal muscle. Hippocampal samples from Alzheimer’s disease donors show decreased BDNF expression and individuals with Alzheimer’s disease have low plasma levels of BDNF. Also, patients with major depression have lower levels of serum BDNF than normal control subjects. Other studies suggest that plasma BDNF is a biomarker of impaired memory and general cognitive function in ageing women and a low circulating BDNF level was recently shown to be an independent and robust biomarker of mortality risk in old women. Low levels of circulating BDNF are also found in obese individuals and those with type 2 diabetes. In addition, we have demonstrated that there is a cerebral output of BDNF and that this is inhibited during hyperglycaemic clamp conditions in humans. This last finding may explain the concomitant finding of low circulating levels of BDNF in individuals with type 2 diabetes, and the association between low plasma BDNF and the severity of insulin resistance.

"BDNF appears to play a role in both neurobiology and metabolism. Studies have demonstrated that physical exercise may increase circulating BDNF levels in humans. To identify whether the brain is a source of BDNF during exercise, eight volunteers rowed for 4 h while simultaneous blood samples were obtained from the radial artery and the internal jugular vein. To further identify the putative cerebral region(s) responsible for BDNF release, mouse brains were dissected and analysed for BDNF mRNA expression following treadmill exercise. In humans, a BDNF release from the brain was observed at rest and increased 2- to 3-fold during exercise. Both at rest and during exercise, the brain contributed 70–80% of the circulating BDNF, while this contribution decreased following 1 h of recovery. In mice, exercise induced a 3- to 5-fold increase in BDNF mRNA expression in the hippocampus and cortex, peaking 2 h after the termination of exercise. These results suggest that the brain is a major but not the sole contributor to circulating BDNF. Moreover, the importance of the cortex and hippocampus as sources of plasma BDNF becomes even more prominent in the response to exercise.”&lt;ref name="Pedersen, Bente Klarlund 2011"/&gt;

With respect to studies of exercise and brain function, a 2010 report is of particular interest. Erickson et al. have shown that the volume of the anterior [[hippocampus]] increased by 2% in response to aerobic training in a randomized controlled trial with 120 older adults. The authors also summarize several previously-established research findings relating to exercise and brain function: (1) Aerobic exercise training increases grey and white matter volume in the prefrontal cortex of older adults and increases the functioning of key nodes in the executive control network. (2) Greater amounts of physical activity have been associated with sparing of prefrontal and temporal brain regions over a 9-y period, which reduces the risk for cognitive impairment. (3) Hippocampal and medial temporal lobe volumes are larger in higher-fit older adults (larger hippocampal volumes have been demonstrated to mediate improvements in spatial memory). (4) Exercise training increases cerebral blood volume and perfusion of the hippocampus.&lt;ref name=pmid21282661/&gt;

Regarding the 2010 study, the authors conclude: "We also demonstrate that increased hippocampal volume is associated with greater serum levels of BDNF, a mediator of neurogenesis in the [[dentate gyrus]]. Hippocampal volume declined in the control group, but higher preintervention fitness partially attenuated the decline, suggesting that fitness protects against volume loss. Caudate nucleus and thalamus volumes were unaffected by the intervention. These theoretically important findings indicate that aerobic exercise training is effective at reversing hippocampal volume loss in late adulthood, which is accompanied by improved memory function."&lt;ref name=pmid21282661/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seldin MM, Peterson JM, Byerly MS, Wei Z, Wong GW | title = Myonectin (CTRP15), a novel myokine that links skeletal muscle to systemic lipid homeostasis | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 287 | issue = 15 | pages = 11968–80 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22351773 | pmc = 3320944 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M111.336834 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decorin===

[[Decorin]] is an example of a proteoglycan which functions as a myokine. Kanzleiter et al have established that this myokine is secreted during muscular contraction against resistance, and plays a role in muscle growth. They reported on July 1, 2014: "The small leucine-rich proteoglycan decorin has been described as a myokine for some time. However, its regulation and impact on skeletal muscle (had) not been investigated in detail. In (our recent) study, we report decorin to be differentially expressed and released in response to muscle contraction using different approaches. Decorin is released from contracting human myotubes, and circulating decorin levels are increased in response to acute resistance exercise in humans. Moreover, decorin expression in skeletal muscle is increased in humans and mice after chronic training. Because decorin directly binds myostatin, a potent inhibitor of muscle growth, we investigated a potential function of decorin in the regulation of skeletal muscle growth. In vivo overexpression of decorin in murine skeletal muscle promoted expression of the pro-myogenic factor Mighty, which is negatively regulated by myostatin. We also found [[MyoD|Myod1]] and [[follistatin]] to be increased in response to decorin overexpression. Moreover, muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases atrogin1 and MuRF1, which are involved in atrophic pathways, were reduced by decorin overexpression. In summary, our findings suggest that decorin secreted from myotubes in response to exercise is involved in the regulation of muscle hypertrophy and hence could play a role in exercise-related restructuring processes of skeletal muscle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kanzleiter T, Rath M, Görgens SW, Jensen J, Tangen DS, Kolnes AJ, Kolnes KJ, Lee S, Eckel J, Schürmann A, Eckardt K | title = The myokine decorin is regulated by contraction and involved in muscle hypertrophy | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 450 | issue = 2 | pages = 1089–94 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24996176 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.06.123 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irisin===

====Discovery ====

Irisin is a cleaved version of [[FNDC5]]. Boström and coworkers named the cleaved product irisin, after the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] messenger goddess [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]].&lt;ref name=pmid22237023&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boström P, Wu J, Jedrychowski MP, Korde A, Ye L, Lo JC, Rasbach KA, Boström EA, Choi JH, Long JZ, Kajimura S, Zingaretti MC, Vind BF, Tu H, Cinti S, Højlund K, Gygi SP, Spiegelman BM | title = A PGC1-α-dependent myokine that drives brown-fat-like development of white fat and thermogenesis | journal = Nature | volume = 481 | issue = 7382 | pages = 463–8 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22237023 | pmc = 3522098 | doi = 10.1038/nature10777 | bibcode = 2012Natur.481..463B }}&lt;/ref&gt; FNDC5 was initially discovered in 2002 by two independent groups of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Teufel A, Malik N, Mukhopadhyay M, Westphal H | title = Frcp1 and Frcp2, two novel fibronectin type III repeat containing genes | journal = Gene | volume = 297 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 79–83 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12384288 | doi = 10.1016/S0378-1119(02)00828-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erickson&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Erickson HP | title = Irisin and FNDC5 in retrospect: An exercise hormone or a transmembrane receptor? | journal = Adipocyte | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 289–93 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24052909 | pmc = 3774709 | doi = 10.4161/adip.26082 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferrer-Martínez A, Ruiz-Lozano P, Chien KR | title = Mouse PeP: a novel peroxisomal protein linked to myoblast differentiation and development | journal = Developmental Dynamics | volume = 224 | issue = 2 | pages = 154–67 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12112469 | doi = 10.1002/dvdy.10099 | s2cid = 42445530 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Function ====

[[Irisin]] (fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 or FNDC5), a recently described myokine hormone produced and secreted by acutely exercising skeletal muscles, is thought to bind white adipose tissue cells via undetermined receptors. Irisin has been reported to promote a [[brown adipose tissue]]-like phenotype upon [[white adipose tissue]] by increasing cellular mitochondrial density and expression of uncoupling protein-1, thereby increasing adipose tissue energy expenditure via [[thermogenesis]]. This is considered important, because excess visceral adipose tissue in particular distorts the whole body energy homeostasis, increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and raises exposure to a milieu of adipose tissue-secreted hormones (adipokines) that promote inflammation and cellular aging. The authors enquired whether the favorable impact of irisin on white adipose tissue might be associated with maintenance of [[telomere]] length, a well-established [[genetic marker]] in the aging process.  They conclude that these data support the view that irisin may have a role in the modulation not only of energy balance but also the aging process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rana KS, Arif M, Hill EJ, Aldred S, Nagel DA, Nevill A, Randeva HS, Bailey CJ, Bellary S, Brown JE | title = Plasma irisin levels predict telomere length in healthy adults | journal = Age | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 995–1001 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24469890 | pmc = 4039281 | doi = 10.1007/s11357-014-9620-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, exogenous irisin may aid in heightening energy expenditure, and thus in reducing obesity. Boström et al. reported on December 14, 2012: "Since the conservation of calories would likely provide an overall survival advantage for mammals, it appears paradoxical that exercise would stimulate the secretion of a polypeptide hormone that increases thermogenesis and energy expenditure. One explanation for the increased irisin expression with exercise in mouse and man may have evolved as a consequence of muscle contraction during shivering. Muscle secretion of a hormone that activates adipose thermogenesis during this process might provide a broader, more robust defense against hypothermia. The therapeutic potential of irisin is obvious. Exogenously administered irisin induces the browning of subcutaneous fat and thermogenesis, and it presumably could be prepared and delivered as an injectable polypeptide. Increased formation of brown or beige/brite fat has been shown to have anti-obesity, anti-diabetic effects in multiple murine models, and adult humans have significant deposits of [[UCP1]]-positive brown fat. (Our data show) that even relatively short treatments of obese mice with irisin improves glucose homeostasis and causes a small weight loss. Whether longer treatments with irisin and/or higher doses would cause more weight loss remains to be determined. The worldwide, explosive increase in obesity and diabetes strongly suggests exploring the clinical utility of irisin in these and related disorders. Another potentially important aspect of this work relates to other beneficial effects of exercise, especially in some diseases for which no effective treatments exist. The clinical data linking exercise with health benefits in many other diseases suggests that irisin could also have significant effects in these disorders."&lt;ref name=pmid22237023/&gt;

While the murine findings reported by Boström et al. appear encouraging, other researchers have questioned whether irisin operates in a similar manner in humans. For example, Timmons et al. noted that over 1,000 genes are upregulated by exercise and examined how expression of FNDC5 was affected by exercise in ~200 humans. They found that it was upregulated only in highly active elderly humans, casting doubt on the conclusions of Boström et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Timmons JA, Baar K, Davidsen PK, Atherton PJ | title = Is irisin a human exercise gene? | journal = Nature | volume = 488 | issue = 7413 | pages = E9–10; discussion E10–1 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22932392 | doi = 10.1038/nature11364 | bibcode = 2012Natur.488E...9T | s2cid = 4415979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further discussion of this issue can be found in the Wikipedia entry for [[irisin]] under the "function" heading.

=== Osteonectin (SPARC) ===
A novel myokine [[osteonectin]], or SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), plays a vital role in bone mineralization, cell-matrix interactions, and collagen binding. Osteonectin inhibits tumorigenesis in mice. Osteonectin can be classed as a myokine, as it was found that even a single bout of exercise increased its expression and secretion in skeletal muscle in both mice and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aoi W, Naito Y, Takagi T, Tanimura Y, Takanami Y, Kawai Y, Sakuma K, Hang LP, Mizushima K, Hirai Y, Koyama R, Wada S, Higashi A, Kokura S, Ichikawa H, Yoshikawa T | title = A novel myokine, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), suppresses colon tumorigenesis via regular exercise | journal = Gut | volume = 62 | issue = 6 | pages = 882–9 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 22851666 | doi = 10.1136/gutjnl-2011-300776 | s2cid = 206955532 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== PGC-1 ===
Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma 1-alpha coactivator ([[PPARGC1A|PGC-1 alpha]]) is a specific myokine since it stimulates Satellite Cells, but stimulates M1 and M2 [[Macrophages]] (M1 macrophages release [[interleukin 6]] (IL-6), Insulin growth factor type 1 ([[IGF-1]]) and [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF), while M2 macrophages mainly secrete IGF-1, VEGF and [[monocyte chemoattractant protein 1]] (MCP-1)) and all this process the muscle becomes muscle hypertrophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-72790-5_5|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-72790-5_5|chapter=Optimized Engagement of Macrophages and Satellite Cells in the Repair and Regeneration of Exercised Muscle|title=Hormones, Metabolism and the Benefits of Exercise|series=Research and Perspectives in Endocrine Interactions|year=2017|last1=Furrer|first1=Regula|last2=Handschin|first2=Christoph|last3=Spiegelman|first3=B.|pages=57–66|pmid=31314461|isbn=978-3-319-72789-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macrophages M2 stimulate Satellite Cells for proliferation and growth but M1 stimulates blood vessels and produces pro-inflammatory cytokines only M2 produces anti-inflammatory in muscles.
=== Myokine in cancer treatments ===
The myokine [[oncostatin M]] has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells, IL-6, IL-15, [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] for the recruitment of [[NK cells]] and replacement of old neutrophils into new and more functional ones and limit induced inflammation by Macrophages M1 and increase in Macrophages M2 (anti-inflammatory).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2020.567881/full|title=Muscle-Organ Crosstalk: Focus on Immunometabolism|last1=Bay|first1=Marie Lund|last2=Pedersen|first2=Bente Klarlund|date=2020|journal=Frontiers in Physiology|volume=11|page=567881|language=en|issn=1664-042X|doi=10.3389/fphys.2020.567881|pmc=7509178|pmid=33013484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AntiGravity Fitness''' is a fitness company founded by [[Christopher Calvin Harrison|Christopher Harrison]] in 2007 and based in [[New York City]], specializing in hybrid aerial fitness techniques that combine [[aerial silk|silk hammocks]] with [[modern yoga]], [[pilates]], [[barre (ballet)|ballet barre exercises]], and traditional [[strength training]] techniques for aerialists into different exercise curriculums. Harrison first developed the initial program, AntiGravity [[aerial yoga]], based on warm-up exercises through which he would lead his athletes as director/choreographer of the performance troupe [[AntiGravity, Inc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/gym-class-antigravity-yoga/?_r=0| work=[[The New York Times]] | title=Gym Class: AntiGravity Yoga | first=Karen | last=Barrow | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1991, Christopher Harrison founded the acrobatic troupe [[AntiGravity, Inc|AntiGravity]] to choreograph a performance for the [[New York Marathon]]. In the following decade, they performed in hundreds of live shows, corporate events, and advertising campaigns. Then in 1997, AntiGravity performed during the opening ceremonies of the [[Femina Miss India]] pageant, and Harrison, while unable to perform due to injury, cites this time in [[India]] as his first exposure to [[yoga]] and a major influence on the development of aerial yoga and what would become AntiGravity Fitness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.outsideonline.com/fitness/flexibility/AntiGravity-Yogas-Upside-Down-Workout.html| work=Outside Online | title=The Upside Down Workout | first=Ali Taylor | last=Lange | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, during a retreat at [[Club Med]], Harrison and his performers came across a [[gazebo]] with hammocks hanging from the ceiling. After experimenting and developing a few flips, they hung up similar hammocks in their [[New York City]] rehearsal studio, The AntiGravity Skyloft. Harrison states that they soon discovered that "hanging upside down for a minute would take all the kinks out". The hammocks soon became a regular part of their warm-up routine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Ken Hutchins''' (born 20th century) is an American inventor who defined and popularized the [[Super Slow]] form of [[Strength training|resistance training]] exercise, and developed methodology, trainer certifications, and exercise equipment to specifically support the techniques.

==Career and activities==
Hutchins was introduced in 1966, to strength training by a family friend who explained the importance of physical strength to musicianship and built Hutchins his first weight bench. Later, in 1968, this friend introduced Hutchins to Ellington Darden, and through Darden in 1971, Hutchins learned of [[Arthur Jones (inventor)|Arthur Jones]] and [[Nautilus, Inc.]] strength-training principles. Hutchins's serious contributions to the field of exercise, began in 1975 when he served Darden as a [[proofreader]] and writer.

In 1977, Hutchins was employed at Nautilus as a [[surgery technician]], writer, surgical photographer, and proofreader. From 1979 to 1982, he served as inside salesperson and traveling speaker, addressing scores of Nautilus clinics yearly.

In 1982, Hutchins and his wife, Brenda, were sent by Arthur Jones to [[Gainesville, Florida]], to supervise the exercise program for the Nautilus-sponsored [[osteoporosis]] study at the [[University of Florida]] Medical School. During this year, Hutchins wrote the SuperSlow Protocol article. He refined its application with over 8,000 one-on-one workouts between 1982 and 1986.

In 1986, Hutchins worked as an exercise equipment designer and prototype developer, specializing in the application of coupled movement arms. In 1987, he compiled historical developments of Nautilus equipment and wrote video scripts for detailed Nautilus education.

After leaving Nautilus, Hutchins established his own exercise practice, continuing to develop the Super Slow techniques and eventually publishing several editions of a technical manual&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, Ken (1989, 1992). ''Super Slow: The Ultimate Exercise Protocol''. Casselberry, Florida: Super Slow Systems. {{ISBN|0-9633199-0-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for the application of Super Slow exercise.

In the early 1990s, a certification program was developed for exercise professionals to bring standardization to SuperSlow training. Hutchins developed an interest group, calling it the Super Slow Exercise Guild (Inc.), which met to refine techniques and published articles in its newsletter, ''The Exercise Standard'', from 1994 to 2000. Numerous similar methods have been spun off by members of the guild and others as their ideas or business models developed.

''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' included Super Slow and Hutchins in the 2001 edition of its annual ''Year in Ideas'' series.&lt;ref&gt;"Year in Ideas...". ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''. December 9, 2001: 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Hutchins and his wife joined Renaissance Exercise, continuing to produce evolutionary designs for exercise equipment. Expanded exercise technique and protocol descriptions&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, Ken (2011). ''The Renaissance of Exercise''. Casselberry, Florida: Renaissance Exercise, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; were published in 2011.

==Contributions==
Hutchins's  major accomplishments during the Nautilus Osteoporosis Project were:
* Composing the Exercise vs. Recreation Philosophy.
* Discovering the principle of the variable counterbalance applied to counterbalance human bodytorque.
* Identifying friction as a major issue in exercise equipment and motor control.
* Identifying four major considerations for the first comprehensive definition of exercise.
* Evolving photographic standardization for comparing the results of exercise and diet programs.
* Discovering that all human muscular functions are negative-cam effects.
* Identifying the conflict between assumed and real objective as a major psychological challenge in exercise.

In the early 1990s, Hutchins and his wife developed and patented the Linear Spine Machines for his company, SuperSlow Systems, Inc. This equipment was designed to provide crucial exercise for severely debilitated back and abdominal musculatures.

'''Strength training''' or '''resistance training''' involves the performance of physical exercises which are designed to improve strength and endurance. It is often associated with the use of [[Weight training|weights]] but can take a variety of different forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Strength Training |url=http://www.fitnesshealth101.com/fitness/weight-training/strength-training |website=FitnessHealth101 |access-date=19 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When properly performed, strength training can provide significant functional benefits and improvement in overall health and well-being, including increased [[bone]], muscle, [[tendon]], and [[ligament]] strength and toughness, improved [[joint]] function, reduced potential for injury,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sports Injuries: Prevention, Management and Risk Factors|vauthors=Shaw I, Shaw BS|publisher=Nova Science Publishers|year=2014|isbn=9781634633055|veditors=Hopkins G|location=Hauppauge, NY|chapter=Resistance Training and the Prevention of Sports Injuries}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased [[bone density]], increased [[metabolism]], increased fitness&lt;ref name="Shaw2009"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Shaw BS, Shaw I|date=2005|title=Effect of resistance training on cardiorespiratory endurance and coronary artery disease risk|journal=Modified Push up Journal of South Africa|volume=16|issue=5|pages=256–59|pmid=16307157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaw2009a"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Shaw BS, Shaw I|date=2009|title=Compatibility of concurrent aerobic and resistance training on maximal aerobic capacity in sedentary males|journal=Cardiovascular Journal of Africa|volume=20|issue=2|pages=104–06|pmc=3721256|pmid=19421643}}&lt;/ref&gt; and improved [[cardiac]] function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.everydayhealth.com/fitness/add-strength-training-to-your-workout.aspx|title=The Benefits of Strength and Weight Training {{!}} Everyday Health|website=EverydayHealth.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training commonly uses the technique of progressively increasing the force output of the muscle through incremental weight increases and uses a variety of exercises and types of [[:Category:Weight training equipment|equipment]] to target specific muscle groups. Strength training is primarily an [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] activity, although some proponents have adapted it to provide the benefits of [[aerobic exercise]] through [[circuit training]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/a-z/circuit-training|title=Circuit Training: What You Do, Benefits, and More|last=Robinson|first=Kara Mayer|website=WebMD|language=en|access-date=2019-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength training is typically associated with the production of lactate, which is a limiting factor of exercise performance. Regular endurance exercise leads to adaptations in skeletal muscle which can prevent lactate levels from rising during strength training. This is mediated via activation of [[PGC-1alpha]] which alter the LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) isoenzyme complex composition and decreases the activity of the lactate generating enzyme LDHA, while increasing the activity of the lactate metabolizing enzyme LDHB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|display-authors=3|vauthors=Summermatter S, Santos G, Pérez-Schindler J, Handschin C|date=2013|title=Skeletal muscle PGC-1α controls whole-body lactate homeostasis through estrogen-related receptor α-dependent activation of LDH B and repression of LDH A|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|volume=110|issue=21|pages=8738–43|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.8738S|doi=10.1073/pnas.1212976110|pmc=3666691|pmid=23650363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sports where strength training is central are [[bodybuilding]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], [[powerlifting]], [[strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]], [[Highland games]], [[shot put]], [[discus throw]], and [[javelin throw]]. Many other sports use strength training as part of their training regimen, notably [[tennis]], [[American football]], [[wrestling]], [[track and field]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[lacrosse]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]], [[pole dancing]], [[hockey]], [[professional wrestling]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], and [[soccer]]. Strength training for other sports and physical activities is becoming increasingly popular.

== Uses ==
The benefits of strength training include greater muscular strength, improved muscle tone and appearance, increased endurance, cardiovascular health, and enhanced bone density.

=== Increased physical attractiveness ===
Many people take up strength training to improve their [[physical attractiveness]]. There is evidence that a body type consisting of broad shoulders and a narrow waist, attainable through strength training, is the most physically attractive male attribute according to women participating in the research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|display-authors=3|vauthors=Mautz BS, Wong BB, Peters RA, Jennions MD|date=2013|title=Penis size interacts with body shape and height to influence male attractiveness|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|volume=110|issue=17|pages=6925–30|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.6925M|doi=10.1073/pnas.1219361110|pmc=3637716|pmid=23569234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most men can develop substantial muscles; most women lack the [[testosterone]] to do it, but they can develop a firm, "toned" (see below) physique, and they can increase their strength by the same proportion as that achieved by men (but usually from a significantly lower starting point). An individual's [[Genetics|genetic]] make-up dictates the response to weight training stimuli to a significant extent. Training can not exceed a muscle's intrinsic genetically determined qualities, though polymorphic expression does occur e.g., [[myosin]]-heavy chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Monitoring Metabolic Status: Predicting Decrements in Physiological and Cognitive Performance|last=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Metabolic Monitoring for Military Field Applications|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2004|isbn=9780309091596|location=Washington, D.C.|chapter=Physiological Biomarkers for Predicting Performance|doi=10.17226/10981|pmid=25009873|chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215705/|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/monitoringmetabo0000unse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies also show that people are able to tell the strength of men based on photos of their bodies and faces, and that physical appearance indicates cues of strengths that are often linked to a man's physical formidability and, therefore, his attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|display-authors=3|vauthors=Sell A, Cosmides L, Tooby J, Sznycer D, von Rueden C, Gurven M|date=2009|title=Human adaptations for the visual assessment of strength and fighting ability from the body and face|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences]]|volume=276|issue=1656|pages=575–584|doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.1177|pmc=2664345|pmid=18945661}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is aligned with studies that reveal those who undergo strength training attain more [[self-esteem]] and [[body cathexis]] when compared to individuals who do not undergo training or exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles and Practice of Resistance Training|vauthors=Stone MH, Stone M, Sands WA|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2007|isbn=9780880117067|location=Champaign, Illinois|pages=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, people who undergo strength training tend to have a more favorable [[body image]] even than those who also engage in regular [[Exercise|physical activities]] such as [[walking]] and [[running]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Body Image Workbook: An Eight-Step Program for Learning to Like Your Looks|vauthors=Cash T|publisher=New Harbinger Publications|year=2008|isbn=9781608826179|location=Oakland, CA|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; More women are also increasingly revealed to be dissatisfied with their body today than those surveyed in 1984 and they often turn to exercise such as strength training to improve their [[body shape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tighten Your Tummy in 2 Weeks: Lose up to 14 Inches &amp; 14 Pounds of Fat in 14 Days!|vauthors=Darden E|publisher=Rodale|year=2015|isbn=9781623365714|location=New York|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increased general physical health ===
Strength training also provides functional benefits. Stronger muscles improve posture, provide better support for [[joint]]s, and reduce the risk of [[injury]] from everyday activities. [[Old age|Older]] people who take up weight training can prevent some of the loss of muscle tissue that normally accompanies [[aging]]—and even regain some functional strength—and by doing so become less frail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Peterson MD, Gordon PM|date=2011|title=Resistance Exercise for the Aging Adult: Clinical Implications and Prescription Guidelines|journal=[[The American Journal of Medicine]]|volume=124|issue=3|pages=194–98|doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2010.08.020|pmid=21396499}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be able to avoid some types of [[physical disability]]. Weight-bearing exercise also helps to prevent [[osteoporosis]] and to improve bone strength in those with osteoporosis.&lt;ref name="pmid21360219"&gt;{{cite journal|display-authors=3|vauthors=Body JJ, Bergmann P, Boonen S, Boutsen Y, Bruyere O, Devogelaer JP, Goemaere S, Hollevoet N, Kaufman JM, Milisen K, Rozenberg S, Reginster JY|date=2011|title=Non-pharmacological management of osteoporosis: a consensus of the Belgian Bone Club|journal=[[Osteoporosis International]]|volume=22|issue=11|pages=2769–88|doi=10.1007/s00198-011-1545-x|pmc=3186889|pmid=21360219}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of weight training for older people have been confirmed by studies of people who began engaging in it even in their 80s and 90s.

Though strength training can stimulate the [[cardiovascular system]], many exercise [[physiologist]]s, based on their observation of maximal [[oxygen]] uptake, argue that [[aerobics]] training is a better cardiovascular stimulus. Central [[catheter]] monitoring during resistance training reveals increased [[cardiac output]], suggesting that strength training shows potential for [[cardiovascular exercise]]. However, a 2007 meta-analysis found that, though aerobic training is an effective therapy for heart failure patients, combined aerobic and strength training is ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|display-authors=3|vauthors=Haykowsky MJ, Liang Y, Pechter D, Jones LW, McAlister FA, Clark AM|date=2007|title=A meta-analysis of the effect of exercise training on left ventricular remodeling in heart failure patients: the benefit depends on the type of training performed|journal=[[Journal of the American College of Cardiology]]|volume=49|issue=24|pages=2329–36|doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2007.02.055|pmid=17572248|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength training may be important to metabolic and cardiovascular health. Recent evidence suggests that resistance training may reduce metabolic and cardiovascular disease risk. Overweight individuals with high strength fitness exhibit metabolic/cardiovascular risk profiles similar to normal-weight, fit individuals rather than overweight unfit individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|display-authors=3|vauthors=Roberts CK, Lee MM, Katiraie M, Krell SL, Angadi SS, Chronley MK, Oh CS, Ribas V, Harris RA, Hevener AL, Croymans DM|date=2015|title=Strength Fitness and Body Weight Status on Markers of Cardiometabolic Health|journal=[[Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise]]|volume=47|issue=6|pages=1211–18|doi=10.1249/MSS.0000000000000526|pmc=5866050|pmid=25251047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For rehabilitation or to address an impairment ===
For many people in [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]] or with an acquired [[disability]], such as following stroke or orthopaedic surgery, strength training for weak muscles is a key factor to optimise recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ada L, Dorsch S, Canning CG|date=2006|title=Strengthening interventions increase strength and improve activity after stroke: A systematic review|journal=[[Australian Journal of Physiotherapy]]|volume=52|issue=4|pages=241–48|doi=10.1016/S0004-9514(06)70003-4|pmid=17132118|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; For people with such a health condition, their strength training is likely to need to be designed by an appropriate health professional, such as a [[physiotherapist]] or an [[occupational therapist]].

=== Increased sports performance ===
Stronger muscles improve performance in a variety of sports. Sport-specific training routines are used by many competitors. These often specify that the speed of [[muscle contraction]] during weight training should be the same as that of the particular sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phillips N|date=1997|title=Essentials of Strength Training and Conditioning|journal=[[Physiotherapy (journal)|Physiotherapy]]|volume=83|issue=1|pages=47|doi=10.1016/s0031-9406(05)66120-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For the pleasure of the activity ===
One side effect of intense exercise is increased levels of [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]], and [[norepinephrine]], which can help to improve mood and counter feelings of [[depression (mood)|depression]] (dopamine and serotonin were not found to be increased by resistance training).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Salmon P|date=2001|title=Effects of physical exercise on anxiety, depression, and sensitivity to stress|journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]]|volume=21|issue=1|pages=33–61|doi=10.1016/S0272-7358(99)00032-X|pmid=11148895}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/exercise-depression|title=Exercise and Depression|website=WebMD|access-date=10 Mar 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as [[myokine]]s which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Pedersen BK|year=2013|isbn=9780470650714|volume=3|pages=1337–62|title=Muscle as a Secretory Organ|doi=10.1002/cphy.c120033|pmid=23897689|issue=3|journal=[[Comprehensive Physiology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technique ==
The basic principles of strength training involve a manipulation of the number of repetitions, sets, tempo, exercises and force to cause desired changes in strength, endurance or size by overloading of a group of muscles. The specific combinations of reps, sets, exercises, resistance and force depend on the purpose of the individual performing the exercise: to gain size and strength multiple (4+) sets with fewer reps must be performed using more force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|display-authors=3|vauthors=Shariat A, Kargarfard M, Danaee M, Bahri Mohd Tamrin S|date=2015|title=Intensive Resistance Exercise and Circadian Salivary Testosterone Concentrations Among Young Male Recreational Lifters|url=http://psasir.upm.edu.my/id/eprint/34227/1/Intensive%20resistance%20exercise%20and%20circadian%20salivary%20testosterone%20concentrations%20among%20young%20male%20recreational%20lifters.pdf|journal=[[Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research]]|volume=29|issue=1|pages=151–58|doi=10.1519/JSC.0000000000000632|pmid=25051005|s2cid=207497997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A wide spectrum of regimens can be adopted to achieve different results, but the classic formula recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine reads as follows:
* 8 to 12 repetitions of a resistance training exercise for each major muscle group at an intensity of 40% to 80% of a one-repetition max (RM) depending on the training level of the participant.
* Two to three minutes of rest is recommended between exercise sets to allow for proper recovery.
* Two to four sets are recommended for each muscle group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Klika B, Jordan C|date=2013|title=High-Intensity Circuit Training Using Body Weight: Maximum Results With Minimal Investment|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6865eed3b4ad7ef54c53d591c698b1911f978f64|journal=[[ACSM's Health &amp; Fitness Journal]]|volume=17|issue=3|pages=8–13|doi=10.1249/fit.0b013e31828cb1e8|s2cid=123383179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, failure to use good form during a training set can result in injury or an inability to meet training goals. When the desired muscle group is not challenged sufficiently, the threshold of [[#Progressive overload|overload]] is never reached and the muscle does not gain in strength. There are cases when cheating is beneficial, as is the case where weaker groups become the weak link in the chain and the target muscles are never fully exercised as a result.

=== Terminology ===
Strength training has a variety of terms used to describe parameters of strength training:
* [[Physical exercise|Exercise]] – different movements which involve rotating joints in specific patterns to challenge muscles in different ways.
* [[Form (exercise)|Form]] – each exercise has a specific form, a topography of movement designed to maximize safety and muscle strength gains.
* Rep – short for repetition, a rep is a single cycle of lifting and lowering a weight in a controlled manner, moving through the form of the exercise.
* [[Weight training|Set]] – a set consists of several repetitions performed one after another with no break between them with the number of reps per set and sets per exercise depending on the goal of the individual. The number of repetitions one can perform at a certain weight is called the Rep Maximum (RM). For example, if one could perform ten reps at 75&amp;nbsp;lb, then that weight would be their 10RM. [[1RM]] is therefore the maximum weight that someone can lift in a given exercise—i.e. a weight that they can only lift once without a break.
* Tempo – the speed with which an exercise is performed; the tempo of a movement has implications for the weight that can be moved and the effects on the muscle.

=== Realization of training goals ===
For developing endurance, gradual increases in volume and gradual decreases in intensity is the most effective program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|display-authors=3|vauthors=Rhea MR, Phillips WT, Burkett LN, Stone WJ, Ball SD, Alvar BA, Thomas AB|date=2003|title=A Comparison of Linear and Daily Undulating Periodized Programs with Equated Volume and Intensity for Local Muscular Endurance|journal=[[The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research]]|volume=17|issue=1|pages=82–7|pmid=12580661|doi=10.1519/1533-4287(2003)017&lt;0082:acolad&gt;2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiterati.co/exercising-enough-to-lose-weight/|title=Exercising Enough To Lose Weight – Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Sports Medicine|last=Joe R|date=2011|website=Fiterati|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009115814/http://www.fiterati.co/exercising-enough-to-lose-weight/|archive-date=9 October 2016|url-status=dead|access-date=10 Mar 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning weight-trainers are in the process of training the neurological aspects of strength, the ability of the brain to generate a rate of [[neuron]]al [[action potential]]s that will produce a muscular contraction that is close to the maximum of the muscle's potential.

Weights for each exercise should be chosen so that the desired number of repetitions can just be achieved.

=== Progressive overload ===
The basic method of weight training uses the principle of [[progressive overload]], in which the [[muscle]]s are overloaded by attempting to lift at least as much weight as they are capable. They respond by growing larger and stronger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Exercise Physiology: Human Bioenergetics and Its Applications|url=https://archive.org/details/exercisephysiolo00broo|url-access=registration|vauthors=Brooks GA, Fahey TD, White TP|publisher=Mayfield Publishing Co|year=1996|isbn=9780072556421}}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure is repeated with progressively heavier weights as the practitioner gains strength and endurance.

However, performing exercises at the absolute limit of one's strength (known as [[One rep maximum|one rep max]] lifts) is considered too risky for all but the most experienced practitioners. Moreover, most individuals wish to develop a combination of strength, endurance and muscle size. One repetition sets are not well suited to these aims. Practitioners therefore lift lighter (sub-maximal) weights, with more repetitions, to fatigue the muscle and all fibres within that muscle as required by the progressive overload principle.

Commonly, each exercise is continued to the point of momentary muscular failure. Contrary to widespread belief, this is not the point at which the individual thinks they cannot complete any more repetitions, but rather the first repetition that fails due to inadequate muscular strength. [[Training to failure]] is a controversial topic with some advocating training to failure on all sets while others believe that this will lead to [[overtraining]], and suggest training to failure only on the last set of an exercise.&lt;ref name="Stoppani"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-980825861.html|title=Fail – to be strong|last=Stoppani J|date=2004|work=[[Muscle &amp; Fitness]]|access-date=19 Jun 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911210441/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-980825861.html|archive-date=11 September 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners recommend finishing a set of repetitions just before reaching a personal maximum at a given time. Adrenaline and other hormones may promote additional intensity by stimulating the body to lift additional weight (as well as the neuro-muscular stimulations that happen when in "fight-or-flight" mode, as the body activates more muscle fibres), so getting "psyched up" before a workout can increase the maximum weight lifted.

Weight training can be a very effective form of strength training because exercises can be chosen, and weights precisely adjusted, to safely exhaust each individual muscle group after the specific numbers of sets and repetitions that have been found to be the most effective for the individual. Other strength training exercises lack the flexibility and precision that weights offer.

=== Split training ===
'''Split training''' involves working no more than three muscle groups or body parts per day, instead spreading the training of specific body parts throughout a training cycle of several days. It is commonly used by more advanced practitioners due to the logistics involved in training all muscle groups maximally. Training all the muscles in the body individually through their full range of motion in a single day is generally not considered possible due to caloric and time constraints. Split training involves fully exhausting individual muscle groups during a workout, then allowing several days for the muscle to fully recover. Muscles are worked roughly twice per week and allowed roughly 72 hours to recover. Recovery of certain muscle groups is usually achieved on days while training other groups, i.e. a 7-day week can consist of a practitioner training trapezius, side shoulders and upper shoulders to exhaustion on one day, the following day the arms to exhaustion, the day after that the rear, front shoulders and back, the day after that the chest. In this way all mentioned muscle groups are allowed the necessary recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWSn4iKgNo8C&amp;q=strength+training+weekly&amp;pg=PP12|title=Science and Practice of Strength Training, Second Edition|vauthors=Kraemer WJ, Zatsiorsky VM|publisher=Human Kinetics Publishers|year=2006|isbn=9780736056281|location=Champaign, Ill|pages=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most common form of training split in recent decades is the '''body-part split''' (sometimes known as "'''bodybuilder split'''" or "'''bro split'''"), which became popular due to being used in [[professional bodybuilding]], and is discussed in a number of sources dedicated to physical training, such as [[Bodybuilding.com]], T-Nation, and Muscle &amp; Strength.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/training-splits-which-one-is-best.html Training Splits: Which One Is Best?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.t-nation.com/training/8-most-effective-training-splits The 8 Most Effective Training Splits]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.muscleandstrength.com/articles/the-ultimate-muscle-building-split-reference-guide.html The Ultimate Muscle Building Split Reference Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of split is structured so that the body is divided up in what are considered the major muscle groups, i.e. chest, back, legs, shoulders, and arms (biceps and triceps), each part is then trained to exhaustion once a week on a dedicated day. Optionally, the biceps can be trained along with the back, due to the fact that they are both involved in pulling movements; conversely, the triceps can be trained along with the chest of the shoulders, as all these muscles are involved in pushing movements. Abdominal work can be spread out over multiple sessions or concentrated on just one day.

Despite the popularity of body-part splits, recent evidence suggests that multiple training sessions for the same muscle group over the course of a week are a more effective training strategy. One recent meta-analysis of experimental trials on resistance training found out that, when total training volume is equated, "frequencies of training twice a week promote superior hypertrophic outcomes to once a week".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s40279-016-0543-8|pmid = 27102172|title = Effects of Resistance Training Frequency on Measures of Muscle Hypertrophy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|journal = Sports Medicine|volume = 46|issue = 11|pages = 1689–1697|year = 2016|last1 = Schoenfeld|first1 = Brad J.|last2 = Ogborn|first2 = Dan|last3 = Krieger|first3 = James W.|s2cid = 207494003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intensity, volume, and frequency ===
Three important variables of strength training are '''intensity''', '''volume''', and '''frequency'''. Intensity refers to the amount of [[mechanical work|work]] required to achieve the activity and is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[mass]] of the weights being lifted. Volume refers to the number of muscles worked, exercises, sets, and reps during a single session. Frequency refers to how many training sessions are performed per week.

These variables are important because they are all mutually conflicting, as the muscle only has so much strength and endurance, and takes time to recover due to [[microtrauma]]. Increasing one by any significant amount necessitates the decrease of the other two, e.g. increasing weight means a reduction of reps, and will require more recovery time and therefore fewer workouts per week. Trying to push too much intensity, volume and frequency will result in [[overtraining]], and eventually lead to injury and other health issues such as chronic soreness and general [[lethargy]], illness or even acute trauma such as [[avulsion fracture]]s. A high-medium-low formula can be used to avoid overtraining, with either intensity, volume, or frequency being high, one of the others being medium, and the other being low. One example of this training strategy can be found in the following chart:

A common training strategy is to set the volume and frequency the same each week (e.g. training 3 times per week, with 2 sets of 12 reps each workout), and steadily increase the intensity (weight) on a weekly basis. However, to maximize progress to specific goals, individual programs may require different manipulations, such as decreasing the weight, and increase volume or frequency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|display-authors=3|vauthors=Campos GE, Luecke TJ, Wendeln HK, Toma K, Hagerman FC, Murray TF, Ragg KE, Ratamess NA, Kraemer WJ, Staron RS|date=2002|title=Muscular adaptations in response to three different resistance-training regimens: Specificity of repetition maximum training zones|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=88|issue=1–2|pages=50–60|doi=10.1007/s00421-002-0681-6|pmid=12436270|s2cid=21473855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making program alterations on a daily basis (daily undulating periodization) seems to be more efficient in eliciting strength gains than doing so every 4 weeks (linear periodization),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|display-authors=3|vauthors=Rhea MR, Ball SD, Phillips WT, Burkett LN|date=2002|title=A comparison of linear and daily undulating periodized programs with equated volume and intensity for strength|url=https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2002/05000/A_Comparison_of_Linear_and_Daily_Undulating.13.aspx|journal=[[Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research]]|volume=16|issue=2|pages=250–55|pmid=11991778}}&lt;/ref&gt; but for beginners there are no differences between different periodization models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|display-authors=3|vauthors=Buford TW, Rossi SJ, Smith DB, Warren AJ|date=2007|title=A comparison of periodization models during nine weeks with equated volume and intensity for strength|journal=[[The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research]]|volume=21|issue=4|pages=1245–50|doi=10.1519/R-20446.1|pmid=18076234|s2cid=124466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Periodization ===
There are many complicated definitions for periodization, but the term simply means the division of the overall training program into periods which accomplish different goals.

Periodization is the modulating of volume, intensity, and frequency over time, to both stimulate gains and allow recovery.

In some programs for example; volume is decreased during a training cycle while intensity is increased. In this template, a lifter would begin a training cycle with a higher rep range than they will finish with.

For this example, the lifter has a 1 rep max of 225&amp;nbsp;lb:

{| class="wikitable"

This is an example of periodization where the number of repetitions decreases while the weight increases.

== Practice of weight training ==

=== Methods and equipment ===
{{See also|Weight training#Types of exercises|l1=Weight training: Types of exercises}}
There are many methods of strength training. Examples include [[weight training]], [[circuit training]], [[isometric exercise]], [[gymnastics]], [[plyometrics]], [[Parkour]], [[yoga]], [[Pilates]], [[Super Slow]].

Strength training may be done with minimal or no equipment, for instance [[bodyweight exercise]]s. [[Exercise equipment|Equipment]] used for strength training includes [[barbells]] and [[dumbbells]], [[weight machine]]s and other [[exercise machine]]s, [[weighted clothing]], [[resistance band]]s, [[:Category:gymnastics apparatus|gymnastics apparatus]], [[Swiss ball]]s, [[wobble board (exercise)|wobble boards]], [[indian club]]s, [[pneumatic exercise equipment]], [[hydraulic exercise equipment]].

=== Aerobic exercise versus anaerobic exercise ===
Strength training exercise is primarily [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]].&lt;ref name="kraemer"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kraemer WJ|date=2003|title=Strength training basics: Designing workouts to meet patients' goals|journal=[[The Physician and Sportsmedicine]]|volume=31|issue=8|pages=39–45|doi=10.3810/psm.2003.08.457|pmid=20086485|s2cid=5384504}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even while training at a lower intensity (training loads of ~20-RM), anaerobic glycolysis is still the major source of power, although [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] metabolism makes a small contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Knuttgen HG|date=2003|title=What is exercise? A primer for practitioners|journal=[[The Physician and Sportsmedicine]]|volume=31|issue=3|pages=31–49|doi=10.1080/00913847.2003.11440567|pmid=20086460|s2cid=58736006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weight training is commonly perceived as anaerobic exercise, because one of the more common goals is to increase strength by lifting heavy weights. Other goals such as rehabilitation, weight loss, body shaping, and bodybuilding often use lower weights, adding aerobic character to the exercise.

Except in the extremes, a muscle will fire fibres of both the aerobic or anaerobic types on any given exercise, in varying ratio depending on the load on the intensity of the contraction.&lt;ref name=Kraemer/&gt; This is known as the energy system continuum. At higher loads, the muscle will recruit all muscle fibres possible, both anaerobic ("fast-twitch") and aerobic ("slow-twitch"), in order to generate the most force. However, at maximum load, the anaerobic processes contract so forcefully that the aerobic fibers are completely shut out, and all work is done by the anaerobic processes. Because the anaerobic muscle fibre uses its fuel faster than the blood and intracellular restorative cycles can resupply it, the maximum number of repetitions is limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dynamicchiropractic.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=31599|title=Muscle Metabolism: Aerobic vs. Anaerobic|last=Griner T|date=2000|work=[[Dynamic Chiropractic]]|issue=7|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aerobic regime, the blood and intracellular processes can maintain a supply of fuel and oxygen, and continual repetition of the motion will not cause the muscle to fail.

[[Circuit weight training]] is a form of exercise that uses a number of weight training exercise sets separated by short intervals. The cardiovascular effort to recover from each set serves a function similar to an aerobic exercise, but this is not the same as saying that a weight training set is itself an aerobic process.

=== Exercises for specific muscle groups ===
{{Main|Weight training exercises}}
[[File:RomanChairBackExtension.JPG|thumb|right|400px|A back extension]]
Weight trainers commonly divide the body's [[List of muscles in the human body|individual muscles]] into ten major muscle groups. These do not include the [[hip]], [[neck]] and [[forearm]] muscles, which are rarely trained in isolation. The most common exercises for these muscle groups are listed below.

The sequence shown below is one possible way to order the exercises. The large muscles of the lower body are normally trained before the smaller muscles of the [[Upper body strength|upper body]], because these first exercises require more mental and physical energy. The core muscles of the [[torso]] are trained before the [[shoulder]] and [[arm]] muscles that assist them. Exercises often alternate between "pushing" and "pulling" movements to allow their specific supporting muscles time to recover. The stabilizing muscles in the [[waist]] should be trained last.

=== Advanced techniques ===
A number of techniques have been developed to make weight training exercises more intense, and thereby potentially increase the rate of progress. Many weight lifters use these techniques to bring themselves past a plateau, a duration where a weightlifter may be unable to do more lifting repetitions, sets, or use higher weight resistance.

==== Set structure ====

===== Drop sets =====
A [[drop set]] is an easy method of strength training where you perform a set of any exercise to failure or right before failure, and then reduce the weight and continue to lift for more repetitions with the decreased weight.

===== Pyramid sets =====
[[Pyramid sets]] are weight training sets in which the progression is from lighter weights with a greater number of repetitions in the first set, to heavier weights with fewer repetitions in subsequent sets.

A reverse pyramid is the opposite in which the heavier weights are used at the beginning and progressively lightened.

===== Burnouts =====
[[Burnouts]] combine pyramids and [[drop set]]s, working up to higher weights with low reps and then back down to lower weights and high reps. There are a few different ways one could perform burnout sets but the main idea is to perform an exercise until failure. You should start with a weight that is 75% of the amount of the maximum amount of weight you can lift for 1 rep. Once you've performed the exercise to exhaustion, reduce the weight and perform another set until failure, which will usually consist of much fewer repetitions. Burnout sets sound very similar to supersets but there are differences in the results they produce. Supersets help increase muscle mass, but are more efficient for producing muscle definition and shape. Burnout sets help increase muscle growth because of the buildup of lactic acid in the muscle when it's forced to the point of failure.

===== Diminishing set =====
The [[diminishing set method]] is where a weight is chosen that can be lifted for 20 reps in one set, and then 70 repetitions are performed in as few sets as possible.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Muscleblasting! Brief and Brutal Shock Training|vauthors=Kennedy R, Ross D|publisher=Sterling|year=1988|isbn=9780806967585|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|17}}

===== Rest-pause =====
The rest-pause training method takes one whole set and breaks it down into a few mini sets. There are two different goals that are associated with rest-pause training, including both hypertrophy and strength. To increase hypertrophy, an athlete typically performs a set at a comfortable weight for 6 to 10 reps and then sets the weight down. Next, they would take 15 seconds' worth of deep breaths, pick the weight back up, and lift to failure. The last step can be repeated any number of times after this, but it is commonly done twice. In order to increase strength using rest-pause method, most people choose a weight that is 85–95% of their one rep max. They then perform 1 rep with this weight, followed by a longer 30- to 45-second break, and repeat this process several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-05-14|title=A Beginner's Guide to Rest-Pause Training|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/rest-pause|access-date=2021-01-26|website=Healthline|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Giant set =====
The Giant set, is a form of training that targets one muscle group (e.g. the triceps) with four separate exercises performed in quick succession, often to failure and sometimes with the reduction of weight halfway through a set once muscle fatigue sets in. This form of intense training 'shocks' the muscles and as such, is usually performed by experienced trainers and should be used infrequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Samelman TR|date=2000|title=Heat Shock Protein Expression is Increased in Cardiac and Skeletal Muscles of Fischer 344 Rats After Endurance Training|journal=[[Experimental Physiology]]|volume=85|issue=1|pages=97–102|doi=10.1111/j.1469-445X.2000.01894.x|pmid=10662898|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== {{anchor|Superset}}Combined sets ====
;Supersets: Supersets combine two or more exercises with similar motions to maximize the amount of work of an individual muscle or group of muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What are supersets? {{!}} Nuffield Health|url=https://www.nuffieldhealth.com/article/what-are-supersets|access-date=2020-12-26|website=www.nuffieldhealth.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The exercises are performed with no rest period in between the exercises. The two main types of supersets are opposing muscle group supersets and same muscle group supersets. An example would be doing bench press, which predominantly works the pectoralis and triceps muscles, and then moving to an exercise that works just the triceps such as the triceps extension or the pushdown.

;Push-pull supersets: Push-pull supersets are similar to regular supersets, but exercises are chosen which work opposing muscle groups. This is especially popular when applied to arm exercises, for example by combining biceps curls with the triceps pushdown. Other examples include the shoulder press and lat pulldown combination, and the bench press and wide grip row combination. A calisthenic example is alternating between pull-ups and dips.

;Pre-exhaustion: Pre-exhaustion combines an isolation exercise with a compound exercise for the same muscle group. The isolation exercise first exhausts the muscle group, and then the compound exercise uses the muscle group's supporting muscles to push it further than would otherwise be possible. For example, the triceps muscles normally help the pectorals perform their function. But in the "bench press" the weaker triceps often fails first, which limits the impact on the pectorals. By preceding the bench press with the pec fly, the pectorals can be pre-exhausted so that both muscles fail at the same time, and both benefit equally from the exercise.

;Breakdowns:Breakdowns were developed by [[Frederick Hatfield]] and [[Mike Quinn (bodybuilder)|Mike Quinn]] to work the different types of [[muscle fiber]]s for maximum stimulation. Three different exercises that work the same muscle group are selected, and used for a superset. The first exercise uses a heavy weight (~85% of [[1 rep max]]) for around five reps, the second a medium weight (~70% of 1 rep max) for around twelve reps, and finally the third exercise is performed with a light weight (~50% of 1 rep max) for twenty to thirty reps, or even lighter (~40% of 1 rep max) for forty or more reps. ([[Training to failure|Going to failure]] is discouraged.) The entire superset is performed three times.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;{{Rp|16–17}}

==== Beyond failure ====
;Forced reps: Forced reps occur after momentary muscular failure. An assistant provides just enough help to get the weight trainer past the [[sticking point]] of the exercise, and allow further repetitions to be completed. Weight trainers often do this when they are [[spotting (weight training)|spotting]] their exercise partner. With some exercises forced reps can be done without a training partner. For example, with one-arm ''biceps curls'' the other arm can be used to assist the arm that is being trained.

;Cheat reps: Cheating is a deliberate compromise of [[Form (exercise)|form]] to maximize reps. Cheating has the advantage that it can be done without a training partner, but compromises [[Strength training#Safety|safety]]. A typical example of cheat reps occurs during biceps curls when, beginning with the load at the waist, the exerciser swings the barbell or dumbbell forward and up during the concentric phase utilizing momentum to assist their bicep muscles in moving the load to a shortened muscle position. Momentum assistance during the concentric phase allows them to move greater loads during the more difficult concentric phase. The objective can be to position greater loads of resistance to the biceps in preparation of performing the eccentric phase than the more difficult concentric phase would otherwise allow. Replacing a typical function of a training partner with a solo exerciser performing cheat reps facilitates forced reps or [[negative repetition|negative reps]] when training alone.

;Weight stripping a.k.a. Number Setting: Weight stripping is a technique used after failure with a normal resistance in certain exercises, particularly with easily adjustable machines, whereby the weight trainer or a partner gradually reduces the resistance after a full set is taken to failure. With each reduction in resistance, as many possible reps are completed and the resistance is then reduced again. This is continued until the resistance is approximately half the original resistance.

;Negative reps: [[Negative repetition|Negative reps]] are performed with much heavier weights. Assistants lift the weight, and then the weight trainer attempts to resist its downward progress through an eccentric contraction. Alternatively, an individual can use an exercise machine for negatives by lifting the weight with both arms or legs, and then lowering it with only one. Or they can simply lower weights more slowly than they lift them: for example, by taking two seconds to lift each weight and four seconds to lower it.

;Partial reps: Partial reps, as the name implies, involves movement through only part of the normal path of an exercise. Partial reps can be performed with heavier weights. Usually, only the easiest part of the repetition is attempted.

;Burns:Burns involve mixing partial reps into a set of full range reps in order to increase intensity. The partials can be performed at any part of the exercise movement, depending on what works best for the particular exercise. Also, the partials can either be added after the end of a set or in some alternating fashion with the full range reps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mass!|vauthors=Kennedy R, Weis D|publisher=Contemporary Books|year=1986|isbn=9780809249404}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after performing a set of ''biceps curls'' to failure, an individual would cheat the bar back to the most contracted position, and then perform several partial reps.

==== Other techniques ====
;Progressive movement training:Progressive movement training attempts to gradually increase the [[range of motion]] throughout a training cycle. The lifter will start with a much heavier weight than they could handle in the full range of motion, only moving through the last 3 to 5 inches of the movement. Throughout the training cycle, the lifter will gradually increase the range of motion until the joint moves through the full range of the exercise. This is a style that was made popular by Paul Anderson.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

;Time under tension: Time under tension or TUT repetitions are performed with lighter weights. Time under tension refers to the amount of time your muscle under stress during a set. This consists of the time spent in the concentric or the shortening phase, peak contraction phase, as well as the eccentric or the lengthening phase. For example, if you go perform a set of 10 reps and each rep takes 3 seconds to complete, your muscle is under tension for a total of 30 seconds. If you were to perform the same exercise but if you spent 2 seconds in the concentric phase, 1 second to stop during peak contraction, and 3 seconds to lower the weight during the eccentric phase of the rep, the same 10 reps would end up putting your muscles under tension for about 60 seconds.

[[File:WristStrap.JPG|right|thumb|150px|Using a wrist strap]]

;Wrist straps: Wrist straps (lifting straps) are sometimes used to assist in gripping very heavy weights. Wrist straps can be used to isolate muscle groups like in "lat pull-downs", where the trainee would primarily use the latissimus dorsi muscles of the back rather than the biceps. They are particularly useful for the ''deadlift''. Some lifters avoid using wrist straps to develop their [[grip strength]], just as some go further by using thick bars. Wrist straps can allow a lifter initially to use more weight than they might be able to handle safely for an entire set, as unlike simply holding a weight, if it is dropped then the lifter must descend with it or be pulled down. Straps place stress on the bones of the wrist which can be potentially harmful if excessive.

== Combined techniques ==
{{See also|Power training}}

Strength training may involve the combining of different training methods such as weight training, plyometrics, bodyweight exercises, and ballistic exercises. This is often done in order to improve a person's ability to apply their strength quickly. Or in other words, to improve their ability to apply explosive power.

=== Loaded plyometrics ===
Loaded plyometrics involve the addition of weights to jumping exercises. The weights may be held or worn. For instance, vertical jumps whilst holding a trap bar or jumping split squats whilst holding dumbbells. This helps to enhance the explosive power of the athlete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Plyometric anatomy|vauthors=Hansen D, Kennelly S|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2017|isbn=9781492533498|location=Champaign, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Complex training ===
Complex training, also known as contrast training, involves the alternation of weight training and plyometric exercises. Ideally, both sets of exercises should move through similar ranges of movement; such a pairing is called a complex, or contrast, pair. For instance, a set of heavy back squats at about 85–95% 1RM followed by a set of jumping exercises. The intention is to utilise the intense nervous system activation and increased muscle fibre recruitment from the heavy lift in the plyometric exercise; thereby increasing the power with which it can be performed. Over a period of training, this may result in the athlete being able to perform the plyometric exercise more powerfully, without the requirement of the preceding heavy lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Designing Resistance Training Programmes|vauthors=Fleck SJ, Kraemer WJ|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2013|isbn=9780736081702|location=Leeds|pages=253|chapter=Complex Training, or Contrast Loading}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working on the same principles, a sports specific action may be incorporated instead of the plyometric exercise; the intention, in this case, being to increase the athlete's ability to perform the sports specific action more powerfully.

=== Ballistic training ===
Ballistic training, sometimes referred to as power training, is based upon the principle of maximizing the acceleration phase of the exercise and minimizing the deceleration phase; this helps to improve the athlete's explosive power. On this basis, ballistic training may include exercises which involve the throwing of a weight, such as a medicine ball, or jumping whilst holding or wearing a weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Designing Resistance Training Programmes|vauthors=Fleck SJ, Kraemer WJ|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2013|isbn=9780736081702|location=Leeds|pages=280|chapter=Ballistic Training}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contrast loading ===
Contrast loading is the alternation of heavy and light loads i.e. a heavy bench press set at about 85–95% 1RM followed by a light bench press set at about 30–60% 1RM. The heavy set should be performed fast with the light set being performed as fast as possible. The joints should not be locked as this inhibits muscle fibre recruitment and reduces the speed at which the exercise can be performed. A loaded plyometric exercise, or ballistic exercise, may take the place of the light lift.

Similarly to complex training, contrast loading relies on the intense nervous system activation and enhanced muscle fibre recruitment from the heavy lift to help improve the power with which the subsequent exercise can be performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Developing Power|vauthors=McGuigan M|publisher=Human Kinetics|year=2017|isbn=9780736095266|location=Leeds|pages=196–7|chapter=Contrast Training}}&lt;/ref&gt; This physiological effect is commonly referred to as post-activation potentiation, or the PAP effect. By way of explanation, if a light weight is lifted, and then a heavy weight is lifted, and then the same light weight is lifted again, then the light weight will feel lighter the second time it is lifted. This is due to the increased PAP effect from the heavy lift allowing for greater power to be applied and thus making the subsequent lighter lift feel even lighter than before. Explosive power training programs are frequently designed to specifically utilize the PAP effect.

=== Bodybuilding ===
{{Main|Bodybuilding}}
[[Bodybuilding]] is a sport in which the goal is to increase muscle size and definition. Bodybuilding increases the endurance of muscles, as well as strength, though not as much as if they were the primary goals. Bodybuilders compete in bodybuilding competitions, and use specific principles and methods of strength training to maximize muscular size and develop extremely low levels of [[adipose tissue|body fat]]. In contrast, most strength trainers train to improve their strength and endurance while not giving special attention to reducing body fat below normal. Strength trainers tend to focus on compound exercises to build basic strength, whereas bodybuilders often use isolation exercises to visually separate their muscles, and to improve muscular [[symmetry]]. Pre-contest training for bodybuilders is different again, in that they attempt to retain as much muscular tissue as possible while undergoing severe [[dieting]]. However, the bodybuilding community has been the source of many strength training principles, techniques, vocabulary, and customs.

== Nutrition ==
{{Main|Sports nutrition}}
It is widely accepted that strength training must be matched by changes in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] in order to be effective. Although aerobic exercise is often observed to have an effect on the dietary intake of macronutrients, strength training has not&lt;ref name="IS2008"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Shaw BS, Shaw I, Brown GA|date=2008|title=Self-reported dietary intake following endurance, resistance and concurrent endurance and resistance training|journal=Journal of Sports Science &amp; Medicine|volume=7|issue=2|pages=255–59|pmc=3761454|pmid=24149458}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an increase in dietary [[protein]] is generally believed to be required for building skeletal muscle.

A review of 49 research studies found that supplementation of protein in the diet of healthy adults increased the size and strength of muscles during prolonged resistance exercise training; protein intakes of greater than 1.6 g/kg/day did not additionally increase fat-free mass or muscle size or strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|display-authors=3|vauthors=Morton RW, Murphy KT, McKellar SR, Schoenfeld BJ, Henselmans M, Helms E, Aragon AA, Devries MC, Banfield L, Krieger JW, Phillips SM|date=2018|title=A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression of the effect of protein supplementation on resistance training-induced gains in muscle mass and strength in healthy adults|journal=[[British Journal of Sports Medicine]]|volume=52|issue=6|pages=376–384|doi=10.1136/bjsports-2017-097608|pmc=5867436|pmid=28698222}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protein that is neither needed for cell growth and repair nor consumed for energy is converted into urea mainly through the deamination process and is excreted by the kidneys.

However, failure to properly hydrate can put an increased strain on the kidney's ability to function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art14944.asp|title=Low Carb, Atkins and Kidneys|last=Shea L|date=2018|website=BellaOnline|access-date=19 Jun 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Manninen AH|date=2005|title=High-protein diets are not hazardous for the healthy kidneys|journal=[[Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation]]|volume=20|issue=3|pages=657–58; author reply 658|doi=10.1093/ndt/gfh645|pmid=15735253}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adequate supply of [[Carbohydrate#Nutrition|carbohydrates]] (5–7&amp;nbsp;g per kg) is also needed as a source of energy and for the body to restore [[glycogen]] levels in muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ivy JL|date=2004|title=Regulation of muscle glycogen repletion, muscle protein synthesis and repair following exercise|journal=Journal of Sports Science &amp; Medicine|volume=3|issue=3|pages=131–38|pmc=3905295|pmid=24482590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A light, balanced meal prior to the workout (usually one to two hours beforehand) ensures that adequate energy and amino acids are available for the intense bout of exercise.

If consuming recovery drink after a workout, to maximize muscle protein anabolism, it is suggested that the recovery drink contain glucose (dextrose), protein (usually [[whey]]) hydrolysate containing mainly dipeptides and tripeptides, and [[leucine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Manninen AH|date=2006|title=Hyperinsulinaemia, hyperaminoacidaemia and post-exercise muscle anabolism: the search for the optimal recovery drink|journal=[[British Journal of Sports Medicine]]|volume=40|issue=11|pages=900–05|doi=10.1136/bjsm.2006.030031|pmc=2465040|pmid=16950882}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some weight trainers also take [[ergogenic aid]]s such as [[creatine]] or [[steroid]]s to aid muscle growth. However, the effectiveness of some products is disputed and others are potentially harmful.

=== Sex differences in mass gains ===

Due to the androgenic hormonal differences between males and females, women are generally unable to develop large muscles regardless of the training program used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://us.commercial.lifefitness.com/content.cfm/strengthtrainingforwomen_1|title=Strength Training for Women|last=Freedson PS|date=2000|work=Life Fitness|access-date=19 Jun 2019|url-status=unfit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716223517/http://us.commercial.lifefitness.com/content.cfm/strengthtrainingforwomen_1|archive-date=16 July 2007|publisher=IDEA Personal Trainer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the most that can be achieved is a look similar to that of a [[fitness and figure competition|fitness model]]. Muscle is [[density|denser]] than fat, so someone who builds muscle while keeping the same body weight will occupy less volume; if two people weigh the same (and are the same height) but have different lean body mass percentages, the one with more muscle will appear thinner.&lt;ref name="Ebben"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ebben WP, Jensen RL|date=1998|title=Strength training for women: Debunking myths that block opportunity|journal=[[The Physician and Sportsmedicine]]|volume=26|issue=5|pages=86–97|doi=10.3810/psm.1998.05.1020|pmid=20086816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, though bodybuilding uses the same principles as strength training, it is with a goal of gaining muscle bulk. Strength trainers with different goals and programs will not gain the same mass as a professional bodybuilder.

=== Muscle toning ===
{{More citations needed|date=February 2012}}
Some weight trainers perform light, high-repetition exercises in an attempt to "tone" their muscles without increasing their size.

The word tone derives from the Latin "tonus" (meaning "tension"). In anatomy and physiology, as well as medicine, the term "muscle tone" refers to the continuous and passive partial contraction of the muscles, or the muscles' resistance to passive stretching during resting state as determined by a deep tendon reflex. [[Muscle tone|Muscle tonus]] is dependent on neurological input into the muscle. In medicine, observations of changes in muscle tonus can be used to determine normal or abnormal states which can be indicative of pathology. The common strength training term "tone" is derived from this use.

What muscle builders refer to as a ''toned physique'' or "muscle firmness" is one that combines reasonable muscular size with moderate levels of body fat, qualities that may result from a combination of diet and exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crossfitimpulse.com/lies-damned-lies-and-muscle-tone/|title=Lies, Damned Lies, and Muscle Tone|date=21 Jun 2010|website=CrossFit Impulse|access-date=19 Jun 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muscle tone or firmness is derived from the increase in [[actin]] and [[myosin]] cross filaments in the [[sarcomere]]. When this occurs the same amount of neurological input creates a greater firmness or tone in the resting continuous and passive partial contraction in the muscle.

Exercises of 6–12 reps cause hypertrophy of the [[sarcoplasm]] in [[Skeletal muscle#Skeletal muscle fiber types|slow-twitch and high-twitch muscle fibers]], contributing to overall increased muscle bulk. This is not to be confused with [[myofibril]] hypertrophy which leads to strength gains. Both, however, can occur to an extent during this rep range. ''Even though most are of the opinion that higher repetitions are best for producing the desired effect of muscle firmness or tone, it is not.'' Low volume strength training of 5 repetitions or fewer will increase strength by increasing [[actin]] and [[myosin]] cross filaments thereby increasing muscle firmness or tone. The low volume of this training will inhibit the hypertrophy effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Snyder GK|date=1995|title=Capillary growth in chick skeletal muscle with normal maturation and hypertrophy|journal=Respiration Physiology|volume=102|issue=2–3|pages=293–301|doi=10.1016/0034-5687(95)00060-7|pmid=8904020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowered-calorie diets have no positive effect on [[muscle hypertrophy]] for muscle of any fiber type. They may, however, decrease the thickness of [[subcutaneous fat]] (fat between muscle and skin), through an overall reduction in body fat, thus making muscle striations more visible.

=== Weight loss ===
Exercises like sit-ups, or abdominal crunches, performs less work than whole-body aerobic exercises&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stamford B|date=1997|title=The right way to do sit-ups|journal=[[The Physician and Sportsmedicine]]|volume=25|issue=6|pages=111–2|doi=10.1080/00913847.1997.11440264}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby expending fewer calories during exercise than jogging, for example.

Hypertrophy serves to maintain muscle mass, for an elevated [[basal metabolic rate]], which has the potential to burn more calories in a given period compared to aerobics. This helps to maintain a higher metabolic rate which would otherwise diminish after metabolic adaption to dieting, or upon completion of an aerobic routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Andersen RE, Jakicic JM|date=2003|title=Physical activity and weight management: Building the case for exercise|journal=[[The Physician and Sportsmedicine]]|volume=31|issue=9|pages=39–45|doi=10.3810/psm.2003.11.557|pmid=20086447|s2cid=40299900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, one can lose weight by being in a [[Caloric deficit|calorie deficit]]. A [[Caloric deficit|calorie deficit]] can be done in different ways; It can be done by consuming less than the amount of calories that are required to maintain your current body weight or by increasing the [[energy expenditure]], enough that is more than the calorie intake. Lean muscles require calories to maintain themselves at rest, which will help reduce fat through an increase in the [[basal metabolic rate]].

{{See also|History of physical training and fitness}} 

[[File:EarlyBarbell.png|right|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Saxon]] performing a [[Two Hands Anyhow]] with an early [[kettlebell]] and plate-loaded [[barbell]]]]
Until the 20th century, the history of strength training was very similar to the history of weight training. With the advent of modern technology, materials and knowledge, the methods that can be used for strength training have multiplied significantly.

[[Hippocrates]] explained the principle behind strength training when he wrote "that which is used develops, and that which is not used wastes away", referring to muscular [[Muscle hypertrophy|hypertrophy]] and [[Atrophy#Muscle atrophies|atrophy]]. Progressive resistance training dates back at least to [[Ancient Greece]], when legend has it that wrestler [[Milo of Croton]] trained by carrying a newborn [[calf]] on his back every day until it was fully grown. Another Greek, the physician [[Galen]], described strength training exercises using the [[halteres (ancient Greece)|halteres]] (an early form of [[dumbbell]]) in the 2nd century. Ancient [[Persia]]ns used the [[Indian club|''meels'']], which became popular during the 19th century as the Indian club, and has recently made a comeback in the form of the clubbell.

The dumbbell was joined by the [[barbell]] in the latter half of the 19th century. Early barbells had hollow globes that could be filled with [[sand]] or [[lead shot]], but by the end of the century these were replaced by the plate-loading barbell commonly used today.&lt;ref name="Todd"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Todd J|date=1995|title=From Milo to Milo: A History of Barbells, Dumbells, and Indian Clubs|url=https://www.academia.edu/3009412|journal=Iron Game History|volume=3|issue=6|pages=4–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strength training with [[isometric exercise]] was popularised by [[Charles Atlas]] from the 1930s onwards. The 1960s saw the gradual introduction of [[exercise machine]]s into the still-rare strength training gyms of the time. Strength training became increasingly popular in the 1980s following the release of the bodybuilding movie ''[[Pumping Iron]]'' and the subsequent popularity of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].&lt;ref name="U.S.C.D.P."&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/13956966|title=Sculpted trend spurs women to pump iron|date=2006|work=NBC News|access-date=19 Jun 2019|publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Special populations ==

=== Safety concerns related to children ===
[[Orthopedic surgery|Orthopaedic]] specialists used to recommend that children avoid weight training because the [[growth plate]]s on their [[bone]]s might be at risk. The very rare reports of growth plate fractures in children who trained with weights occurred as a result of inadequate supervision, improper form or excess weight, and there have been no reports of injuries to growth plates in youth training programs that followed established guidelines.&lt;ref name="KH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/parent/nutrition_fit/fitness/strength_training.html|title=Strength Training and Your Child|last=Dowshen S, Homeier B|date=2005|website=kidshealth.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702002412/https://kidshealth.org/parent/nutrition_fit/fitness/strength_training.html|archive-date=2 July 2008|url-status=dead|access-date=18 Jan 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NSCA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/download/Youth%20Hot%20Topics.pdf|title=Youth Resistance Training|last=Faigenbaum AD|publisher=National Strength and Conditioning Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717045321/http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/download/Youth%20Hot%20Topics.pdf|archive-date=17 July 2011|url-status=unfit|access-date=18 Jan 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of the National Strength and Conditioning Association is that strength training is safe for children if properly designed and supervised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/YouthforWeb.pdf|title=Position statement: Youth Resistance Training|publisher=National Strength and Conditioning Association|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717045336/http://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/YouthforWeb.pdf|archive-date=17 July 2011|url-status=unfit|access-date=18 Jan 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Younger children are at greater risk of injury than adults if they drop a weight on themselves or perform an exercise incorrectly; further, they may lack understanding of, or ignore the safety precautions around weight training equipment. As a result, supervision of minors is considered vital to ensuring the safety of any youth engaging in strength training.&lt;ref name = KH/&gt;&lt;ref name = NSCA/&gt;

==== Australia's stance on pre-adolescence strength training  ====
Strength training is the fourth most popular form of fitness in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/health-and-wellness/top-fitness-trends-for-2015-20150106-12j220.html|title=Top fitness trends for 2015|last=Berry S|date=2015|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=19 Jun 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its popularity amongst all ages, there is great scepticism on what the appropriate age to commence strength training in young athletes is. Some points of the opposing view of strength training in young adolescence are stunted growth, health and bone problems in later stages of life and unhealthy eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/Default.aspx?id=3076614&amp;p1=0#.VzrQuJF97ic|title=Should kids pump iron?|last=Stenson J|date=2003|work=[[MSNBC]]|access-date=19 Jun 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies by Australian experts that have been recognised by the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] (AIS) have debunked these myths. There is no link between any prolonged health risks and strength training in pre-adolescence if the procedures of strength training are followed correctly and under suitable supervision. Strength training for pre-adolescents should focus on skills and techniques. Children should only work on strengthening all the big muscle groups, using free weight and body weight movements with relatively light loads. The benefits of these practices include increased strength performance, injury prevention and learning good training principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ausport.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/145971/Article_weight_training_preadolescent_strength_training_Narelle_Sibte.pdf|title=Weight training - Pre-adolescent strength training - Just do it!|last=Sibte N|date=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313145336/https://www.ausport.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/145971/Article_weight_training_preadolescent_strength_training_Narelle_Sibte.pdf|archive-date=13 March 2018|url-status=unfit|access-date=19 Jun 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== For older adults ===
Older adults are prone to loss of muscle strength.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Christie J|date=2011|title=Progressive resistance strength training for improving physical function in older adults|journal=[[International Journal of Older People Nursing]]|volume=6|issue=3|pages=244–46|doi=10.1111/j.1748-3743.2011.00291.x|pmid=21884490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Liu CJ, Latham NK|date=2009|title=Progressive resistance strength training for improving physical function in older adults|journal=[[The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews]]|issue=3|pages=CD002759|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002759.pub2|pmc=4324332|pmid=19588334}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more strength older adults have better health, better [[quality of life]], better physical function&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; and fewer [[Falling (accident)|falls]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; In cases in which an older person begins strength training, their doctor or health care provider may neglect to emphasize a strength training program which results in muscle gains.

In setting up an exercise program for an older adult, they should go through a [[Baseline (medicine)|baseline]] fitness assessment to determine their current limits. Any exercise program for older adults should match the intensity, frequency, and duration of exercise that the person can perform. The program should have a goal of increased strength as compared to the baseline measurement.&lt;ref name="APTAfive"/&gt;

Recommended training for older adults is three times a week of light strength training exercises. Exercise machines are a commonly used equipment in a gym setting, including treadmills with exercises such as walking or light jogging. Home-based exercises should usually consist of body weight or elastic band exercises that maintain a low level of impact on the muscles. Weights can also be used by older adults if they maintain a lighter weight load with an average amount of repetitions (10–12 reps) with suitable supervision. It is important for older adults to maintain a light level of strength training with low levels of impact to avoid injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Keuerleber J, Henschke N|date=2012|title=Progressive resistance strength training can reduce physical disability in older adults|journal=[[British Journal of Sports Medicine]]|volume=46|issue=5|pages=323–24|doi=10.1136/bjsports-2012-091018|pmid=22442190|s2cid=29563104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older people who exercise against a resistance or force become stronger.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Progressive resistance training (PRT) also improves physical functioning in older people, including the performance of simple (e.g.: walking, climbing stairs, rising from a chair more quickly) and complex daily activities (e.g.: bathing, cooking).&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Caution is recommended when transferring PRT exercises for clinical populations, as adverse effects are unclear.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

A '''push-up''' (sometimes called a '''press-up''' in [[British English]]) is a common [[calisthenics]] [[Physical exercise|exercise]] beginning from the [[prone position]]. By raising and lowering the body using the arms, push-ups exercise the [[pectoralis major muscle|pectoral]] muscles, [[triceps]], and anterior [[deltoid muscle|deltoids]], with ancillary benefits to the rest of the deltoids, [[serratus anterior muscle|serratus anterior]], [[coracobrachialis muscle|coracobrachialis]] and the midsection as a whole. Push-ups are a basic exercise used in civilian athletic training or [[physical education]] and commonly in [[Military Fitness|military physical training]]. They are also a common form of [[punishment]] used in the military, school sport, and some [[martial arts]] disciplines.

==Etymology==
The American English term ''push-up'' was first used between 1905 and 1910,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=push-up | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/push-up | year=2015 | author=Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House | publisher=Dictionary.com | access-date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the British ''press-up'' was first recorded between 1945 and 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=press-up |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/press-upp |year=2006 |author= Oxford Dictionaries, Oxford University Press |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |access-date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=press-up | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/press-up | year=2015 | author=Random House Unabridged Dictionary, Random House | publisher=Dictionary.com | access-date=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Body mass supported during push-ups==
According to the study published in Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, the test subjects supported with their hands, on average, 69.16% of their [[body mass]] in the up position, and 75.04% in the down position during the traditional push-ups. In modified push-ups, where [[knees]] are used as the pivot point, subjects supported 53.56% and 61.80% of their body mass in up and down positions, respectively.&lt;ref name="suprak"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suprak|first1=David N|last2=Dawes|first2=Jay|last3=Stephenson|first3=Mark D|title=The Effect of Position on the Percentage of Body Mass Supported During Traditional and Modified Push-up Variants|journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research|date=February 2011|volume=25|issue=2|pages=497–503|doi=10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181bde2cf|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41548700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muscles worked==
While the push-up primarily targets the muscles of the chest, arms, and shoulders, support required from other muscles results in a wider range of muscles integrated into the exercise.&lt;ref name="ACE"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acefitness.org/exerciselibrary/41/push-up/ |title=Push-up |work=acefitness.org |publisher=[[American Council on Exercise]] |access-date=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File: Marines do pushups.jpg|thumb|Military recruits will often perform push-ups as part of their physical training. Here, U.S. Marine recruits at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego perform push-ups in May 2005, as a part of their basic recruit training.]]

=== Abdominals ===
The [[Rectus abdominis muscle|rectus abdominis]] and [[Transversus abdominis muscle|transversus abdominis]] contract continually while performing push-ups to hold the body off the floor and keep the legs and [[torso]] aligned. The rectus abdominis spans the front of the abdomen and is the most prominent of the abdominal muscles. The transversus abdominis lies deep within the abdomen, wrapping around the entire abdominal area. Both muscles compress the abdomen, and the rectus abdominis also flexes the spine forward, although it does not execute this function when performing push-ups.

=== Deltoid ===
The anterior portion of the [[deltoid muscle]] is one of the major shoulder-joint horizontal adductors, moving the upper arms toward the chest during the upward phase of a push-up. It also helps control the speed of movement during the downward phase. The deltoid attaches to parts of the [[clavicle]] and [[scapula]], just above the [[Glenohumeral joint|shoulder joint]] on one end, and to the outside of the [[humerus bone]] on the other. Along with horizontal adduction, the anterior deltoid assists with flexion and internal rotation of the humerus within the shoulder socket.

=== Chest muscles ===
The push up requires the work of many muscle groups, with one of the primary muscle groups being the chest muscles, the [[Pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis major]] and the [[Pectoralis minor muscle|minor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.md-health.com/What-Muscles-Do-Push-Ups-Work.html|title=What Muscles Do Push-Ups Work?|work=MDhealth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the two large chest muscles and the main pushing muscle group of the upper body. When pushing and lowering the body during a push-up, the pectoralis major is doing most of the work. As a result, these muscles become very strong and can become defined as lean muscle after doing push-ups regularly.

=== Stabilisers: back body ===
The push-up depends on stabiliser muscles as the body is pushed and lowered. The [[Erector spinae muscles|erector spinae]] is the main stabiliser muscle in the back. Made up of three muscles including the spinal, longissimus, and iliocostalis. The spinal runs adjacent to the spine, the longissimus runs adjacent to the spinal and the iliocostalis runs adjacent to the longissimus and over the ribs. Two muscles called the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus stabilises the upper leg. The medius and minimus sit under the largest butt muscle, the gluteus maximus.

=== Triceps brachii ===
While the anterior deltoids and pectoralis major muscles work to horizontally adduct the upper arms during the upward phase of a push-up, the [[triceps brachii]] muscles, or triceps for short, are also hard at work extending the elbow joints so the arms can be fully extended. The triceps also control the speed of elbow-joint flexion during the downward phase of the exercise. The closer together the hands are placed during a push-up, the harder the triceps work. The muscle is divided into three heads — the lateral head, long head, and medial head. The lateral and medial heads attach to the back of the humerus bone, and the long head attaches just behind the shoulder socket on one end; all three heads combine and attach to the back of the elbow on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/341958-which-muscles-does-a-push-up-work/|title=Which Muscles Does a Push-Up Work?|author=Matthew Schirm|work=Live Well - Jillian Michaels}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is a special sub-set of the diamond push-up (so named for the diamond-shaped space between the hands when the thumb and forefinger of the left hand are placed on the floor up against the thumb and forefinger of the right hand.) The special version of this push-up is when the diamond is placed directly below the nose instead of the solar plexus. The nose must almost touch the floor in the center of the diamond. This special diamond push-up is done by the United States Marine Corps. The lips must come within 1 inch of the floor while keeping the neck in line with the straight spine to qualify as a valid push-up. This can be verified by placing a 1-inch foam disposable earplug on the floor in the center of the diamond and picking it up with the lips.

=== Forearms ===
Stabilizers include wrist and forearm muscles, the knee extensors, and the hip/spine flexors, which all work isometrically to maintain a proper plank position in the standard prone push-up.

=== Biceps ===
During the push-up exercise, the short head of the [[biceps brachii]] muscle acts as a dynamic stabilizer. This means the muscle activates at both ends—the elbow and the shoulder—to help stabilize the joints.

=== Joints and tendons ===
Inner muscles that support the operation of the fingers, wrists, forearms, and elbows are also worked isometrically. Some push-up modifications that require to have the arms at different heights effectively engage the rotator cuff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehealthsciencejournal.com/10-level-push-ups-series-building-ultimate-strength/|title=10 Level Push-ups Series for Building Ultimate Strength|author=Melissa Bell|work=www.thehealthsciencejournal.com |publisher=[[The Health Science Journal]] |access-date=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
In the "full push-up", the back and legs are straight and off the floor. There are several variations besides the common push-up. These include bringing the thumbs and index fingers of both hands together (a "diamond push-up") as well as having the elbows pointed towards the knees. These variations are intended to put greater emphasis on the [[triceps brachii muscle|triceps]] or shoulders, rather than the chest muscles. When both hands are unbalanced or on uneven surfaces, this exercise works the body core. Raising the feet or hands onto elevated surfaces during the exercise emphasizes the upper (minor) or lower (major) pectorals, respectively. Raising the hands with the aid of push-up bars or a dumbbell allows for a greater range of motion, providing further stress for the muscles.
===Weighted push-ups=== 
Progressively overloading classic push-ups using barbell plates, resistance bands or any form of weight. The load is usually positioned on the upper back. This very effective exercise is not commonly performed because of the difficulty of loading the human body in that position.

===Knee push-ups===
"Modified" or "knee" push-ups are performed by supporting the lower body on the knees instead of the toes, which reduces the difficulty. These are sometimes used in fitness tests for women, corresponding to regular push-ups for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Try This Test to Measure Upper Body Strength|url=https://www.verywellfit.com/push-up-test-for-upper-body-strength-and-endurance-3120272|access-date=2020-07-27|website=Verywell Fit|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is useful for warm-ups/downs, pyramids/drop sets, endurance training, and rehab. It can also be used to train in a more explosive plyometric manner (like clapping push-ups) when one can't perform them with the feet. It can also be used with the 1-arm variations as a transition. However, the intense pressure on the knees can be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Are Girl Push-Ups Just as Effective as Regular Push-Ups? / Fitness / Exercises|url=https://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/fitness/exercises/are-girl-push-ups-just-as-effective-as-regular-push-ups.html|access-date=2020-07-27|website=www.fitday.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planche push-ups===
[[Image:Planche.jpg|thumb|right|Planche position]]
An extremely difficult variation is to perform a push-up using only hands, without resting the feet on the floor, i.e., starting from and returning to the [[Planche (exercise)|planche]] position. These are known as "planche push-ups". To do this variation, the body's center of gravity must be kept over the hands while performing the push-up by leaning forward while the legs are elevated in the air, which requires great strength and a high level of balance. The entire body weight is lifted in this variation.

===Knuckle push-ups===
Another variation is to perform push-ups on the knuckles of the fist, rather than with palms of the hands on the floor. This method is also commonly used in [[martial arts]], such as [[Karate]] and [[Tae Kwon Do]], and may be used in boxing training while wearing [[boxing gloves]].

The intent, in addition to building strength and conditioning, is to toughen the knuckles, wrist, and forearm in the punching position. This variation also reduces the amount of strain in the wrist, compared to the typical "palms on floor" approach, and so it is sometimes used by those with wrist injuries. Such practitioners will usually perform their knuckle push-ups on a padded floor or a rolled-up towel, unlike martial artists, who may do bare-knuckle push-ups on hard floors.

===Maltese push-up===
The ''Maltese push-up'' is a gymnastic variation of the push-up, in which the hands are positioned further down towards the [[hip (anatomy)|hips]] (as opposed to roughly alongside the [[pectoralis major muscle|pectorals]]), but with a wide distance between them.

===Hindu push-up===
{{see also|sun salutation}}
[[File:Dand (Basic).gif|thumb|The Hindu push-up, also known as a dand. This is the most basic version, similar to that used by Bruce Lee who referred to it as a cat stretch.]]
Also known as ''dand''. The most basic form of ''Hindu push-up'' starts from the [[downward dog]] [[yoga]] position (hands and feet on the floor with the posterior raised) and transitions to a [[cobra pose]] position (hands and feet on the floor with the torso arched forwards and the legs close to the floor). It is common in [[India]]n physical culture and [[Indian martial arts]], particularly [[Pehlwani]].&lt;ref&gt;Mujumdar D.C., ''The Encyclopedia of Indian Physical Culture'', 1950, p.460, plate 131&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Lee also used it in his training regime and referred to it as a 'cat stretch'.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Bruce,
'Preliminaries' in ''The Tao of Jeet Kune Do'', California: Ohara Publications, 1975, p.29&lt;/ref&gt; It is an effective core strength exercise because it dynamically involves both the [[anterior chain| anterior]] and [[posterior chain|posterior]] chains in a harmonious fashion. There are numerous variations of the Hindu push-up although most incorporate the two postures used in the most basic version. It may also be known as a [[Hanuman]], [[judo]], or dive-bomber push-up.

===Guillotine push-up===
The ''guillotine push-up'' is a form of push-up done from an elevated position (either hands-on elevated platforms or traditionally [[medicine balls]]) wherein the practitioner lowers the [[chest]], [[human head|head]], and [[neck]] (thus the name) past the plane of the hands. The goal is to stretch the [[shoulder]]s and put extra emphasis on the [[muscle]]s there.

===Backhanded push-up===
The ''backhanded push-up'' is a form of push-ups performed using the back of the hands, rather than the palms. Currently, the record holder of the backhanded push-ups is Bill Kathan who broke the world record in 2010, by performing 2,396 on [[Valentine's Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.grandcanyonnews.com/news/2010/feb/23/grand-canyon-record-breaker-does-it-again/|title=Grand Canyon record-breaker does it again - Grand Canyon News - Grand Canyon, Arizona|last=Whitehurst|first=Patrick|work=Grand Canyon News|access-date=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===One arm versions===
[[File: US Army 52113 FORSCOM employee excels at fitness competition.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Army employee demonstrates a one-arm push-up in an extended position.]]
Many of the push-up variations can be done using one arm instead of two. This will further increase the resistance put upon the trainee.

===Single-leg push-up===
To do single leg push-up lift one of your leg off the ground and do a set. Repeat the same with another leg.

===Narrow-grip push-up===
Do a normal push-up with your hands just a few inches apart from each other underneath the chest.

===Wide-grip push-up===
Similar to a normal push-up but with hands wider than shoulder width. This works the chest and shoulders more.

===Clap push-up===
At the peak of the push-up, push yourself up off the ground and quickly clap in midair. The fast jolting force of clap push-ups will help develop explosive power while also bulking up the pectoral muscles for a more defined chest.

===Spiderman push-up===
Do a normal push-up but raise one knee toward the elbow of the same side as you rise. Switch knees with each rep.
Also, add more stress to your abs with a 2-second hold.

===Other versions===
There are some less difficult versions, which reduce the effort by supporting some of the bodyweights in some way. One can move on to the standard push-up after progress is made.

"Wall" push-ups are performed by standing close to a wall and pushing away from the wall with the arms; one can increase the difficulty by moving one's feet farther from the wall.

"Table" or "chair" push-ups are performed by pushing away from a table, chair, or other object. The lower the object, the more difficult the push-up. One should be sure that the object is securely stationary before attempting to push up from it.

"Three-phase" push-ups involve simply breaking a standard push up into three components and doing each one slowly and deliberately. Participants usually start face down on the floor with hands outstretched either perpendicular or parallel to the body. The first phase involves the arms being brought palms down on a 90-degree angle at the elbows. The second phase involves the body being pushed into the up position. The third phase is returning to the starting position. This technique is commonly used after a large block of regular push-ups, as it poses less stress and requires less effort.

"Diamond" or "Triceps" push-ups are done by placing both palms on the ground and touching together both thumbs and pointer fingers. This technique requires stronger triceps muscles than regular push-ups because, at the bottom of the stroke, the forearm is nearly parallel to the ground and the elbow is almost completely flexed, resulting in a much higher mechanical load on the triceps.

"Hollow-Body" push-ups are performed in the position gymnasts call the "hollow body". In the plank version of the hollow body, the shoulders are protracted into a pronounced curve in the upper back while the abdominal muscles are tightened and the legs are locked and squeezed together. This variation requires full-body tension to execute and results in greater integration of the hips, shoulders, and core.

===Plyometrics===
Two platforms are placed beside the trainee, one on either side. The exercise begins with the hands-on either platform supporting the body, then the subject drops to the ground and explosively rebounds with a push-up, extending the torso and arms completely off the ground and returning the hands to the platforms.

Another is simply an explosive push-up where a person attempts to push quickly and with enough force to raise his or her hands' several centimeters off the ground, with the body completely suspended on the feet for a moment, a variation of the drop push. This is necessary for performing 'clap push-ups' - i.e. clapping the hands while in the air.

'''Aztec push-ups'''

The Aztec push-up is one of the most difficult plyometric push-ups.  A person performs an Aztec push-up by beginning in the normal push-up starting position and exploding upward with both the hands and feet, driving the entire body into the air.  While in the air, the body is bent at the waist and the hands quickly touch the toes.  The body is then quickly straightened and the hands and feet break the fall, returning the body to the normal push-up position for another repetition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strength.stack52.com/periodic-table-of-bodyweight-exercises/|title=Bodyweight Exercises Periodic Table with How-To Videos|work=Strength Stack 52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''360 push ups'''

The 360 push-up is a variation of the superman push-up where one rotates 360 degrees while in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0mNQsPMuHQ|title=19 Variations of Push Up Exercises (The Best Chest Builders Ever!)|date=26 December 2012|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''' Falling and explosive rebound push ups'''&lt;br /&gt;
Here one falls to the ground from standing position and then using an explosive push-up gets back to standing position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naRaVsFn_g4|title=10-15 Crazy Extreme Push Ups - Calisthenics Street Workout 2013 (HD)|date=1 June 2013|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With push-ups, many possibilities for customization and increased intensity are possible. Some examples are: One hand can be set on a higher platform than the other or be farther away from the other to give more weight to the opposite arm/side of the body and also exercise many diverse muscles. One can perform push-ups by using only the tips of the fingers and thumb. For increased difficulty, push-ups can be performed on one arm or using weights.

Push-ups between chairs form an integral part of the "Dynamic Tension" Course devised by [[Charles Atlas]], and similar systems.

==In the animal kingdom==
There are [[zoology]] observations that certain animals emulate a ''push up'' action. Most notably various taxa of the [[Fence lizard (disambiguation)|fence lizard]] exhibit this display,&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Burton and Robert Burton (2002) ''International Wildlife Encyclopaedia'', published by Marshall Cavendish {{ISBN|0-7614-7272-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily involving the male engaging in postures to attract females. The [[western fence lizard]] is a particular species that also engage in this behavior.&lt;ref&gt;C.

[[Image:Dipexercise.svg|right|thumb|300px|Dip exercise using a [[dip bar]] ]]
A '''dip''' is an upper-body [[strength exercise]]. Narrow, shoulder-width dips primarily train the [[triceps]], with major [[Anatomical terms of muscle#Synergist|synergist]]s being the [[anterior deltoid]], the [[Pectoralis major muscle|pectoralis]] muscles ([[Human sternum|sternal]], clavicular, and minor), and the [[rhomboid muscles]] of the back (in that order).&lt;ref name=ex_triceps&gt;{{cite web|title=Triceps Dip|url=http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/Triceps/BWTriDip.html|publisher=exrx.net|access-date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wide arm training places additional emphasis on the [[pectoral muscles]], similar in respect to the way a wide grip [[bench press]] would focus more on the pectorals and less on the triceps.&lt;ref name=ex_chest&gt;{{cite web|title=Chest Dip|url=http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/PectoralSternal/BWChestDip.html|publisher=exrx.net|access-date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern meaning==
To perform a dip, the exerciser supports themselves on a [[dip bar]] or from a set of [[Rings (gymnastics)|rings]] with their arms straight down and shoulders over their hands, then lowers their body until their arms are bent to a 90 degree angle at the elbows, and then lifts their body up, returning to the starting position.

==Variation==
[[File:Dip and pull-up machine.jpg|thumb|Combined dip and pull-up machine with weights]]
Usually dips are done on a [[dip bar]], with the exerciser's hands supporting their entire body weight. For added resistance, weights can be added by use of a [[dip belt]], weighted vest, or by wearing a backpack with weights in it. A dumbbell may also be held between the knees or ankles. For less resistance, an assisted dip/pull-up machine can be used which reduces the force necessary for the exerciser to elevate their body by use of a counterweight. One may also use resistance bands hooked under their feet to help if they lack the strength to properly perform a dip.

In the absence of this equipment, a lighter variation of the dip can be performed called the "Bench Dip". The hands are placed on one bench directly underneath the shoulders or on two parallel benches.&lt;ref name=ex_chest_bench&gt;{{cite web|title=Chest Dip (between benches)|url=http://www.exrx.net/WeightExercises/PectoralSternal/BWChestDipBenches.html|publisher=exrx.net|access-date=3 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legs are straightened and positioned horizontally; the feet rest on another bench in front of the exerciser. This variation trains the upper body muscles in a similar though not exact manner as the normal dip, whilst reducing the total weight lifted by a significant amount. This exercise can be done also off of the edge of a sofa, a kitchen counter, or any surface that supports the lifter.

[[Image:Roman chair (hyperextension) animation.gif|thumb|Hyperextensions being performed using a [[Roman chair]] for support]]
A '''hyperextension''' or '''back extension''' is an exercise that works the lower back as well as the mid and upper back, specifically the [[erector spinae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sports-health.com/sports-injuries/knee-injuries/understanding-knee-hyperextension|title=Understanding Knee Hyperextension|last=MD|first=Sean Colio|work=Sports-health|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;


It may be performed on the ground by lying prone with arms overhead and lifting the arms, upper torso, and legs as far as possible, or  using a [[Roman chair]] to hold the feet down and hips up. Another version is the '''bird dog''' exercise, performed lying on the knees, where one arm and the opposite leg are lifted.

The '''crunch''' is one of the most popular [[abdominal exercise]]s. When performed properly, it engages all the abdominal muscles but primarily it works the [[rectus abdominis muscle]] and the [[Abdominal external oblique muscle|obliques]]. It allows both building six-pack abs, and tightening the belly.  Crunches use the exerciser's own body weight to tone muscle, and are recommended as a low-cost exercise that can be performed at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Exercising on a budget|website=MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000762.htm|access-date=20 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Form==
[[File:Crunches-2.png|thumb|right|200px|In a crunch, the lower back does not lift off the floor]]
The [[biomechanics]] professor Stuart McGill was quoted in ''[[The New York Times]] Health'' [[blog]] as stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;An approved crunch begins with you lying down, one knee bent, and hands positioned beneath your lower back for support. "Do not hollow your stomach or press your back against the floor", McGill says. Gently lift your head and shoulders, hold briefly and relax back down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a crunch, unlike a [[sit-up]], the [[lower back]] stays on the floor. This is said to eliminate any involvement by the [[hip flexors]], and make the crunch an effective [[isolation exercise]] for the abdominals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.issaonline.edu/blog/index.cfm/2016/are-sit-ups-bad-for-you-the-us-military-seems-to-think-so|title=Are Sit Ups Bad for You?

'''Weight training''' is a common type of  [[strength training]] for developing the [[physical strength|strength]] and size of [[skeletal muscle]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Keogh, Justin W, and Paul W Winwood. “Report for: The Epidemiology of Injuries Across the Weight-Training Sports.” ''Altmetric – Vitamin C Antagonizes the Cytotoxic Effects of Antineoplastic Drugs'', Mar. 2017, summon.altmetric.com/details/8964732.&lt;/ref&gt; It utilizes the [[force of gravity]] in the form of weighted bars, [[dumbbell]]s or [[Weight plate|weight stacks]] in order to oppose the force generated by muscle through [[Concentric contraction|concentric]] or [[eccentric contraction]]. Weight training uses a variety of specialized [[:Category:Weight training equipment|equipment]] to target specific muscle groups and types of movement.

Sports  in which weight training is used are : [[bodybuilding]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], [[powerlifting]], [[strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]], [[highland games]], [[hammer throw]], [[shot put]], [[discus throw]], and [[javelin throw]]. Many other sports use strength training as part of their training regimen, notably: [[American football]], [[baseball]], [[basketball]], [[canoeing]], [[cricket]], [[association football|football]], [[hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]], [[track and field]], [[boxing]] and [[wrestling]].

In many prehistoric tribes, they would have a big rock they would try to lift, and the first one to lift it would inscribe their name into the stone. Such rocks have been found in [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] castles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/weightlifting|title=Weightlifting {{!}} sport|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Progressive resistance training dates back at least to [[Ancient Greece]], when legend has it that wrestler [[Milo of Croton]] trained by carrying a newborn [[calf (animal)|calf]] on his back every day until it was fully grown. Another Greek, the physician [[Galen]], described strength training exercises using the [[halteres (ancient Greece)|halteres]] (an early form of [[dumbbell]]) in the 2nd century.

Ancient Greek sculptures also depict lifting feats. The weights were generally stones, but later gave way to dumbbells. The dumbbell was joined by the barbell in the later half of the 19th century. Early barbells had hollow globes that could be filled with [[sand]] or [[lead shot]], but by the end of the century these were replaced by the plate-loading barbell commonly used today.&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;Todd, Jan (1995). [http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/IGH/IGH0306/IGH0306c.pdf From Milo to Milo: A History of Barbells, Dumbbells, and Indian Clubs.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731101012/http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/IGH/IGH0306/IGH0306c.pdf |date=2012-07-31 }} Iron Game History (Vol.3, No.6).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early device was the [[Indian club]], which came from ancient India where it was called the "mugdar" or &lt;nowiki&gt;''gada''&lt;/nowiki&gt;. It subsequently became popular during the 19th century, and has recently made a comeback in the form of the clubbell.

Weightlifting was first introduced in the Olympics [[1896 Summer Olympics|in the 1896 Athens Olympic games]] as a part of track and field, and was officially recognized as its own event in 1914.[https://www.britannica.com/sports/weightlifting]

The 1960s saw the gradual introduction of [[exercise machine]]s into the still-rare strength training [[gym]]s of the time. Weight training became increasingly popular in the 1970s, following the release of the bodybuilding movie ''[[Pumping Iron]],'' and the subsequent popularity of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. Since the late 1990s increasing numbers of women have taken up weight training; currently nearly one in five U.S. women engage in weight training on a regular basis.&lt;ref name=U.S.C.D.P.&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/13956966|title=NBC News article on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on the prevalence of strength training|access-date=2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic principles==
{{Main|Strength training}}
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
[[File:101 Armenian Woman Exercising Shoulder Back Press.png|thumb|upright|A woman doing weight training at a [[health club]] with her coach standing behind her.]]

The basic principles of weight training are essentially identical to those of strength training, and involve a manipulation of the number of repetitions (reps), sets, tempo, exercise types, and weight moved to cause desired increases in strength, endurance, and size. The specific combinations of reps, sets, exercises, and weights depends on the aims of the individual performing the exercise.

In addition to the basic principles of ''strength training'', a further consideration added by weight training is the equipment used.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Types of equipment include [[barbell]]s, dumbbells, kettlebells, pulleys and stacks in the form of [[weight machine]]s, and the body's own weight in the case of [[chin-up]]s and [[Press up|push-ups]]. Different types of weights will give different types of resistance, and often the same absolute weight can have different relative weights depending on the type of equipment used. For example, lifting 10 kilograms using a dumbbell sometimes requires more force than moving 10 kilograms on a weight stack if certain pulley arrangements are used. In other cases, the weight stack may require more force than the equivalent dumbbell weight due to additional torque or resistance in the machine. Additionally, although they may display the same weight stack, different machines may be heavier or lighter depending on the number of pulleys and their arrangements.

Weight training also requires the use of proper or '[[Form (exercise)|good form]]', performing the movements with the appropriate muscle group, and not transferring the weight to different body parts in order to move greater weight (called '[[Cheating#Sports|cheating]]'). Failure to use good form during a training set can result in injury or a failure to meet training goals. If the desired muscle group is not challenged sufficiently, the threshold of [[Strength training#Progressive overload|overload]] is never reached and the muscle does not gain in strength. At a particularly advanced level; however, "cheating" can be used to break through strength plateaus and encourage neurological and muscular adaptation.

==Safety==
Weight training is a safe form of exercise when the movements are controlled and carefully defined. However, as with any form of exercise, improper execution and the failure to take appropriate precautions can result in injury. If injured, full recovery is suggested before starting to weight train again or it will result in a bigger injury.

===Maintaining proper form===
[[File:DumbbellDeadlift.JPG|thumb|A [[dumbbell]] [[half-squat]].&lt;ref name="Rippetoe-2005"&gt;In the first picture, the knees are too close and get twisted. For appropriate muscular development and safety the knee should be in line with the foot. {{cite book|last= Rippetoe|first= Mark| name-list-style = vanc |author-link=Mark Rippetoe|author2=Lon Kilgore |title=Starting Strength|url= https://archive.org/details/startingstrength00ripp|url-access= limited|publisher=The Aasgard Company|year=2005|isbn=978-0-9768054-0-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/startingstrength00ripp/page/n46 46]–49|chapter=Knees}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Maintaining proper form is one of the many steps in order to perfectly perform a certain technique. Correct form in weight training improves strength, muscle tone, and maintaining a healthy weight. Proper form will prevent any strains or fractures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/weight-training/art-20045842?pg=2|title=Weight training: Do's and don'ts of proper technique - Mayo Clinic|website=www.mayoclinic.org|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the exercise becomes difficult towards the end of a set, there is a temptation to cheat, i.e., to use poor form to recruit other muscle groups to assist the effort. Avoid heavy weight and keep the number of repetitions to a  minimum. This may shift the effort to weaker muscles that cannot handle the weight. For example, the [[squat (exercise)|''squat'']] and the ''[[deadlift]]'' are used to exercise the largest muscles in the body—the [[Human leg|leg]] and [[buttock]] muscles—so they require substantial weight. Beginners are tempted to round their back while performing these exercises. The relaxation of the spinal erectors which allows the lower back to round can cause shearing in the vertebrae of the lumbar spine, potentially damaging the spinal discs.

===Stretching and warm-up===
Weight trainers commonly spend 5 to 20 minutes [[warming up]] their muscles before starting a workout.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} It is common to stretch the entire body to increase overall [[Flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]]; many people stretch just the area being worked that day. It has been observed that static stretching can increase the risk of injury due to its analgesic effect and cellular damage caused by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Marjorie A. |last2=Hutton |first2=Robert S. |title=Electromyographic investigation of muscle stretching techniques |journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise |date=1980 |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=322–329 |doi=10.1249/00005768-198012050-00004 |pmid=7453508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A proper warm-up routine, however, has shown to be effective in minimizing the chances of injury, especially if they are done with the same movements performed in the weigh lifting exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Herman |first1=Katherine |last2=Barton |first2=Christian |last3=Malliaras |first3=Peter |last4=Morrissey |first4=Dylan |title=The effectiveness of neuromuscular warm-up strategies, that require no additional equipment, for preventing lower limb injuries during sports participation: a systematic review |journal=BMC Medicine |date=December 2012 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=75 |doi=10.1186/1741-7015-10-75 |pmid=22812375 |pmc=3408383 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When properly warmed up the lifter will have more strength and stamina since the blood has begun to flow to the muscle groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McMillian |first1=Danny J. |last2=Moore |first2=Josef H. |last3=Hatler |first3=Brian S. |last4=Taylor |first4=Dean C. |s2cid=16389590 |title=Dynamic vs. Static-Stretching Warm Up: The Effect on Power and Agility Performance |journal=The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research |date=2006 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=492–9 |doi=10.1519/18205.1 |pmid=16937960 |citeseerx=10.1.1.455.9358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breathing===
In weight training, as with most forms of exercise, there is a tendency for the breathing pattern to deepen. This helps to meet increased oxygen requirements. Holding the breath or breathing shallowly is avoided because it may lead to a lack of oxygen, passing out, or an increase in [[blood pressure]]. Generally, the recommended breathing technique is to inhale when lowering the weight (the eccentric portion) and exhale when lifting the weight (the concentric portion). However, the reverse, inhaling when lifting and exhaling when lowering, may also be recommended. Some researchers state that there is little difference between the two techniques in terms of their influence on [[heart rate]] and blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Steven J | last1 = Fleck | first2 = William J | last2 = Kraemer | name-list-style = vanc |title=Designing resistance training programs |isbn=978-0-7360-8170-2 |edition=Fourth | location = Leeds | publisher = Human Kinetics | date = 2014 | page = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be recommended that a weight lifter simply breathes in a manner which feels appropriate.
 
Deep breathing may be specifically recommended for the lifting of heavy weights because it helps to generate [[Core stability#Intra-abdominal pressure|intra-abdominal pressure]] which can help to strengthen the [[Good posture|posture]] of the lifter, and especially their [[core (anatomy)|core]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Right Way to Breathe For More Powerful Weightlifting|url=https://vitals.lifehacker.com/the-right-way-to-breathe-for-more-powerful-weightliftin-1765146303|access-date=2021-01-12|website=Vitals|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular situations, a coach may advise performing the [[valsalva maneuver]] during exercises which place a load on the spine. The vasalva maneuver consists of closing the windpipe and clenching the abdominal muscles as if exhaling, and is performed naturally and unconsciously by most people when applying great force. It serves to stiffen the abdomen and torso and assist the back muscles and spine in supporting the heavy weight. Although it briefly increases blood pressure, it is still recommended by weightlifting experts such as [[Mark Rippetoe|Rippetoe]] since the risk of a stroke by aneurysm is far lower than the risk of an orthopedic injury caused by inadequate rigidity of the torso.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rippetoe|first1=Mark|author-link=Mark Rippetoe|first2 = Lon | last2 = Kilgore | name-list-style = vanc |title=Starting Strength|url=https://archive.org/details/startingstrength00ripp|url-access=limited|publisher=The Aasgard Company|year=2005|isbn=978-0-9768054-0-3|pages=[https://archive.org/details/startingstrength00ripp/page/n46 46]–49|chapter=Squat}} &lt;!--Needs reference to page number, proper citation of "Starting Strength", and some source for the relevant statistics on the types of injuries, if possible, not from "Starting Strength" itself, to give a second source of support.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some medical experts warn that the mechanism of building "high levels of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP)...produced by breath holding using the Valsava maneuver", to "ensure spine stiffness and stability during these extraordinary demands", "should be considered only for extreme weight-lifting challenges — not for rehabilitation exercise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Stuart | last = McGill | title = Low Back Disorders | url = https://archive.org/details/lowbackdisorders00mcgi | url-access = limited | edition = 2d | publisher = Human Kinetics | date = 2007 | chapter = Breathing | pages = [https://archive.org/details/lowbackdisorders00mcgi/page/n189 186]–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydration===
As with other sports, weight trainers should avoid [[dehydration]] throughout the workout by drinking sufficient water. This is particularly true in hot environments, or for those older than 65.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/balance/features/water-water-everywhere|title=Water, Water, Everywhere|website=WebMD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.msn.com/blogs/healthy-diet-fit-body-post.aspx?post=1188190|title=Metabolism Myth #5|publisher=MSN Health|author=Mark Dedomenico}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ACSM07"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=American College of Sports Medicine |last2=Sawka |first2=MN |last3=Burke |first3=LM |last4=Eichner |first4=ER |last5=Maughan |first5=RJ |last6=Montain |first6=SJ |last7=Stachenfeld |first7=NS |s2cid=400815 |title=American College of Sports Medicine position stand: Exercise and fluid replacement |journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise |date=February 2007 |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=377–390 |doi=10.1249/mss.0b013e31802ca597 |pmid=17277604 |url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3c33/33413c4cb5674f56e3783a9105a6c7a2d773.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/04/02/eveningnews/main3991145.shtml|title=Busting The 8-Glasses-A-Day Myth|publisher=CBS|author=Nancy Cordes | date=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dms.dartmouth.edu/news/2002_h2/08aug2002_water.shtml|title="Drink at Least 8 Glasses of Water a Day" - Really?|publisher=Dartmouth Medical School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some athletic trainers advise athletes to drink about {{convert|7|impfloz|mL}} every 15 minutes while exercising, and about {{convert|80|impfloz|L}} throughout the day.&lt;ref name="Johnson-Cane 75"&gt;Johnson-Cane et al., p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Does 'dL' refer to deci-litre?? --&gt;

However, a much more accurate determination of how much fluid is necessary can be made by performing appropriate weight measurements before and after a typical exercise session, to determine how much fluid is lost during the workout. The greatest source of fluid loss during exercise is through perspiration, but as long as your fluid intake is roughly equivalent to your rate of perspiration, hydration levels will be maintained.&lt;ref name="ACSM07" /&gt;

Under most circumstances, [[sports drinks]] do not offer a physiological benefit over water during weight training.&lt;ref name="Johnson-Cane 76"&gt;Johnson-Cane et al., p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; However, high-intensity exercise for a continuous duration of at least one hour may require the replenishment of electrolytes which a sports drink may provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/hydrationandfluid/a/ProperHydration.htm |title=Hydration and Exercise - What to Drink for Proper Hydration During Exercise |publisher=Sportsmedicine.about.com |date=2011-04-15 |access-date=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/2009-07-01-Drinks_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Overuse of energy drinks worries health pros | first=Michael | last=McCarthy | name-list-style = vanc | date=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'Sports drinks' that contain simple carbohydrates &amp; water do not cause ill effects, but are most likely unnecessary for the average trainee.

Insufficient hydration may cause lethargy, soreness or [[muscle cramps]].&lt;ref name="Johnson-Cane 153"&gt;Johnson-Cane et al., p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; The [[urine]] of well-hydrated persons should be nearly colorless, while an intense yellow color is normally a sign of insufficient hydration.&lt;ref name="Johnson-Cane 153" /&gt;

===Avoiding pain===
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2011}}

An exercise should be halted if marked or sudden pain is felt, to prevent further injury. However, not all discomfort indicates injury. Weight training exercises are brief but very intense, and many people are unaccustomed to this level of effort. The expression "[[no pain, no gain]]" refers to working through the discomfort expected from such vigorous effort, rather than to willfully ignore extreme pain, which may indicate serious [[soft tissue]] injuries. The focus must be proper form, not the amount of weight lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/7-tips-for-a-safe-and-successful-strength-training-program|title=7 tips for a safe and successful strength-training program | publisher = Harvard Health|work=Harvard Health Publishing |access-date=2018-03-16}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/885186487 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/884138996 cite #23 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template. [[User:GreenC bot/Job 18]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discomfort can arise from other factors. Individuals who perform large numbers of repetitions, sets, and exercises for each muscle group may experience a burning sensation in their muscles. These individuals may also experience a swelling sensation in their muscles from increased blood flow also known as edema (the "pump"). True [[muscle fatigue]] is experienced as loss of power in muscles due to a lack of ATP, the energy used by our body, or a marked and uncontrollable loss of strength in a muscle, arising from the [[nervous system]] ([[motor unit]]) rather than from the muscle fibers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Find your fit: Weight training |journal=Arkansas Business |volume=35 |issue=4 |year=2018 |pages=S30–S31 |id={{ProQuest|1994247717}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme neural fatigue can be experienced as temporary muscle failure. Some weight training programs, such as Metabolic Resistance Training, actively seek temporary muscle failure; evidence to support this type of training is mixed at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.trainingscience.net/?page_id=635|title=Is Training To Failure Necessary?|date=2012-03-27|work=Training Science|access-date=2017-03-31|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401061226/http://www.trainingscience.net/?page_id=635|archive-date=2017-04-01|url-status=dead}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/885186487 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/884138996 cite #24 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template. [[User:GreenC bot/Job 18]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irrespective of their program, however, most athletes engaged in high-intensity weight training will experience muscle failure during their regimens.

Beginners are advised to build up slowly to a weight training program. Untrained individuals may have some muscles that are comparatively stronger than others; nevertheless, an injury can result if (in a particular exercise) the primary muscle is stronger than its stabilizing muscles. Building up slowly allows muscles time to develop appropriate strengths relative to each other. This can also help to minimize [[delayed onset muscle soreness]]. A sudden start to an intense program can cause significant muscular soreness. Unexercised muscles contain cross-linkages that are torn during intense exercise. A regimen of flexibility exercises should be implemented before and after workouts. Since weight training puts great strain on the muscles, it is necessary to warm-up properly. Kinetic stretching before a workout and static stretching after are a key part of flexibility and injury prevention.

===Other precautions===
Anyone beginning an intensive physical training program is typically advised to consult a [[physician]], because of possible undetected heart or other conditions for which such activity is contraindicated.

Exercises like the [[bench press]] or the [[Squat (exercise)|squat]] in which a failed lift can potentially result in the lifter becoming trapped under the weight are normally performed inside a [[Power cage|power rack]] or in the presence of one or more [[Spotting (weight training)|spotters]], who can safely re-rack the barbell if the weight trainer is unable to do so. In addition to spotters, knowledge of proper form and the use of safety bars can go a long way to keep a lifter from suffering injury due to a failed repetition.

==Equipment==
{{Main|Exercise equipment}}
[[File:WristStrap.JPG|thumb|150px|Lifting straps]]
[[File:LiftingBelt.JPG|thumb|150px|Lifting belt]]

Weight training usually requires different types of equipment, most commonly kettle bells, [[dumbbell]]s, [[barbell]]s, [[weight plate]]s, and [[weight machine]]s. Various combinations of [[List of weight training exercises|specific exercises]], machines, dumbbells, and barbells allow trainees to exercise body parts in numerous ways.

Other types of equipment include:
* Lifting straps, which allow more weight to be lifted by transferring the load to the wrists and avoiding limitations in forearm muscles and [[grip strength]].
* Weightlifting belts, which are meant to brace the core through intra-abdominal pressure (and not directly assist the lower back muscles as commonly believed). Controversy exists regarding the safety of these devices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kingma |first1=Idsart |last2=Faber |first2=Gert S. |last3=Suwarganda |first3=Edin K. |last4=Bruijnen |first4=Tom B. M. |last5=Peters |first5=Rob J. A. |last6=van Dieën |first6=Jaap H. |s2cid=22138551 |title=Effect of a Stiff Lifting Belt on Spine Compression During Lifting |journal=Spine |date=October 2006 |volume=31 |issue=22 |pages=E833–E839 |doi=10.1097/01.brs.0000240670.50834.77 |pmid=17047531 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their proper use is often misunderstood. Powerlifting belts, which are thick and have the same width all around, are designed for maximum efficiency but can be uncomfortable, especially for athletes with a narrow waist, as they exert pressure on the ribs and hips during the lifts. Some rare models which are wide on the back and the front but narrower on the sides present a good compromise between comfort and efficiency.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}
* [[Weighted clothing]], bags of sand, [[lead shot]], or other materials that are strapped to wrists, ankles, torso or other body parts to increase the amount of work required by muscles
* Gloves can improve grip, prevent the formation of calluses on the hands, relieve pressure on the wrists, and provide support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/17819-benefits-wearing-weight-lifting-gloves/|title = The benefits of wearing weight lifting gloves}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[MgCO3|Chalk (MgCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)]], which dries out sweaty hands, improving grip.
* Wrist and knee wraps.
* Shoes, which have a flat, rigid sole to provide a sturdy base of support, and may feature a raised heel of varying height (usually 0.5" or 0.75") to accommodate a lifter's biomechanics for more efficient squats, deadlifts, overhead presses, and [[Olympic weightlifting|Olympic lifts]].

==Types of exercises==
{{see also|List of weight training exercises}}

===Isolation exercises versus compound exercises===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
[[File:LegExtensionMachineExercise.JPG|thumb|The ''leg extension'' is an isolation exercise.]]
[[File:SwissBallSquat.JPG|thumb|The ''dumbell squat'' is a compound exercise. An [[exercise ball]] can be used for support and allow for a wider range of exercises to be performed. They are also known as Swiss balls or stability balls.]]

An '''isolation exercise''' is one where the movement is restricted to one joint only. For example, the ''leg extension'' is an isolation exercise for the quadriceps. Specialized types of equipment are used to ensure that other muscle groups are only minimally involved—they just help the individual maintain a stable posture—and movement occurs only around the knee joint. Isolation exercises involve machines, dumbbells, barbells (free weights), and pulley machines. Pulley machines and free weights can be used when combined with special/proper positions and joint bracing.

'''Compound exercises''' work several muscle groups at once, and include movement around two or more joints. For example, in the ''leg press'', movement occurs around the hip, knee and ankle joints. This exercise is primarily used to develop the quadriceps, but it also involves the hamstrings, glutes and calves. Compound exercises are generally similar to the ways that people naturally push, pull and lift objects, whereas isolation exercises often feel a little unnatural.

Each type of exercise has its uses. Compound exercises build the basic strength that is needed to perform everyday pushing, pulling and lifting activities. Isolation exercises are useful for "rounding out" a routine, by directly exercising muscle groups that cannot be fully exercised in the compound exercises.

The type of exercise performed also depends on the individual's goals. Those who seek to increase their performance in sports would focus mostly on compound exercises, using isolation exercises to strengthen just those muscles that are holding the athlete back. Similarly, a [[powerlifter]] would focus on the specific compound exercises that are performed at powerlifting competitions. However, those who seek to improve the look of their body without necessarily maximizing their strength gains (including [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilders]]) would put more of an emphasis on isolation exercises. Both types of athletes, however, generally make use of both compound and isolation exercises.&lt;ref&gt;Henselmans, Menno. “Compound vs. Isolation Exercises: Which Is Best? [Study Review].” ''MennoHenselmans.com'', 16 Jan. 2019, mennohenselmans.com/compound-vs-isolation-exercise/.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free weights versus weight machines===
[[File:WeightStack.JPG|thumb|206x206px|The weight stack from a [[cable machine]].]]

'''Free weights''' include [[dumbbell]]s, [[barbell]]s, [[medicine ball]]s, [[sandbell]]s, and [[kettlebell]]s. Unlike [[weight machine]]s, they do not constrain users to specific, fixed movements, and therefore require more effort from the individual's stabilizer muscles. It is often argued that free weight exercises are superior for precisely this reason. For example, they are recommended for golf players, since golf is a unilateral exercise that can break body balances, requiring exercises to keep the balance in muscles.&lt;ref&gt;Ahn Hyejung (November 11, 2012), ''World Class Fitness Trainers, [[John Sitaras]]'', [[Golf Digest]] (Korean edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some free weight exercises can be performed while sitting or lying on an [[exercise ball]].

There are a number of '''weight machines''' that are commonly found in neighborhood gyms. The [[Smith machine]] is a barbell that is constrained to vertical movement. The [[cable machine]] consists of two weight stacks separated by 2.5 metres, with cables running through adjustable pulleys (that can be fixed at any height so as to select different amounts of weight) to various types of handles. There are also exercise-specific [[weight machine]]s such as the [[leg press]]. A multigym includes a variety of exercise-specific mechanisms in one apparatus.

One limitation of many free weight exercises and exercise machines is that the muscle is working maximally against gravity during only a small portion of the lift. Some exercise-specific machines feature an oval [[cam]] (first introduced by [[Nautilus, Inc.|Nautilus]]) which varies the resistance, so that the resistance, and the muscle force required, remains constant throughout the full range of motion of the exercise.

===Push-pull workout===
A push–pull workout is a method of arranging a weight training routine so that exercises alternate between push motions and pull motions.&lt;ref name=EIRM&gt;
{{cite book

  | isbn = 978-0-7360-5541-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A push–pull superset is two complementary segments (one pull/one push) done back-to-back. An example is [[bench press]] (push) / [[bent-over row]] (pull). Another push–pull technique is to arrange workout routines so that one day involves only push (usually chest, shoulders and triceps) exercises, and an alternate day only pull (usually back and biceps) exercises so the body can get adequate rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.flexonline.com/training/push-pull-training|title=Push-Pull Training|work=FLEX Online|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotonic and plyometric exercises===
These terms combine the prefix ''iso-'' (meaning "same") with ''tonic'' ("strength") and ''plio-'' ("more") with ''metric'' ("distance"). In "isotonic" exercises the force applied to the muscle does not change (while the length of the muscle [[Concentric contraction|decreases]] or [[Eccentric contraction|increases]]) while in "plyometric" exercises the length of the muscle stretches and contracts rapidly to increase the power output of a muscle.

Weight training is primarily an '''isotonic''' form of exercise, as the force produced by the muscle to push or pull weighted objects should not change (though in practice the force produced does decrease as muscles fatigue). Any object can be used for weight training, but dumbbells, barbells, and other specialised equipment are normally used because they can be adjusted to specific weights and are easily gripped. Many exercises are not strictly isotonic because the force on the muscle varies as the joint moves through its range of motion. Movements can become easier or harder depending on the angle of muscular force relative to gravity; for example, a standard biceps curl becomes easier as the hand approaches the shoulder as more of the load is taken by the structure of the elbow. Originating from [[Nautilus, Inc.]], some machines use a logarithmic-spiral [[cam]] to keep resistance constant irrespective of the joint angle.

[[Plyometrics]] exploit the stretch-shortening cycle of muscles to enhance the myotatic (stretch) reflex. This involves rapidly altering the lengthening and shortening of muscle fibers against resistance. The resistance involved is often a weighted object such as a [[medicine ball]] or sandbag, but can also be the body itself as in jumping exercises or the body with a weight vest that allows movement with resistance. Plyometrics is used to develop explosive speed, and focuses on maximal [[Power (physics)|power]] instead of maximal strength by compressing the force of muscular contraction into as short a period as possible, and may be used to improve the effectiveness of a [[boxing|boxer's]] punch, or to increase the vertical jumping ability of a [[basketball]] player. Care must be taken when performing plyometric exercises because they inflict greater stress upon the involved joints and tendons than other forms of exercise.

==Health benefits==
Benefits of weight training include increased strength, muscle mass, endurance, bone and bone mineral density, insulin sensitivity, GLUT 4 density, HDL cholesterol, improved cardiovascular health and appearance, and decreased body fat, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Westcott |first1=Wayne L. |s2cid=11977370 |title=Resistance Training is Medicine: Effects of Strength Training on Health |journal=Current Sports Medicine Reports |date=2012 |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=209–216 |doi=10.1249/JSR.0b013e31825dabb8 |pmid=22777332 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body's [[basal metabolic rate]] increases with increases in muscle mass, which promotes long-term [[dieting|fat loss]] and helps dieters avoid [[yo-yo dieting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbass.com/METABOLI.HTM|title=Fat Loss Article: Metabolism Myth|work=cbass.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, intense workouts elevate [[metabolism]] for several hours following the workout, which also promotes fat loss.&lt;ref name=De2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meirelles |first1=Cláudia de Mello |last2=Gomes |first2=Paulo Sergio Chagas |title=Efeitos agudos da atividade contra-resistência sobre o gasto energético: revisitando o impacto das principais variáveis |journal=Revista Brasileira de Medicina do Esporte |date=April 2004 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=122–130 |doi=10.1590/S1517-86922004000200006 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weight training also provides functional benefits. Stronger muscles improve posture, provide better support for [[joint]]s, and reduce the risk of [[injury]] from everyday activities. [[Old age|Older]] people who take up weight training can prevent some of the loss of muscle tissue that normally accompanies [[aging]]—and even regain some functional strength—and by doing so, become less frail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mayer |first1=Frank |last2=Scharhag-Rosenberger |first2=Friederike |last3=Carlsohn |first3=Anja |last4=Cassel |first4=Michael |last5=Müller |first5=Steffen |last6=Scharhag |first6=Jürgen |title=The Intensity and Effects of Strength Training in the Elderly |journal=Deutsches Ärzteblatt Online |date=27 May 2011 |volume=108 |issue=21 |pages=359–364 |doi=10.3238/arztebl.2011.0359 |pmid=21691559 |pmc=3117172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be able to avoid some types of [[physical disability]]. Weight-bearing exercise also helps to increase bone density to prevent [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Layne |first1=Jennifer E. |last2=Nelson |first2=Miriam E. |title=The effects of progressive resistance training on bone density: a review |journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise |date=January 1999 |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=25–30 |doi=10.1097/00005768-199901000-00006 |pmid=9927006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of weight training for older people have been confirmed by studies of people who began engaging in it even in their eighties and nineties.

For many people in [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitation]] or with an acquired [[disability]], such as following stroke or orthopaedic surgery, strength training for weak muscles is a key factor to optimise recovery.&lt;ref name="pmid17132118"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ada |first1=Louise |last2=Dorsch |first2=Simone |last3=Canning |first3=Colleen G. |title=Strengthening interventions increase strength and improve activity after stroke: a systematic review |journal=Australian Journal of Physiotherapy |date=2006 |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=241–248 |doi=10.1016/s0004-9514(06)70003-4 |pmid=17132118 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; For people with such a health condition, their strength training is likely to need to be designed by an appropriate health professional, such as a [[physiotherapist]].

Stronger muscles improve performance in a variety of sports. Sport-specific training routines are used by many competitors. These often specify that the speed of [[muscle contraction]] during weight training should be the same as that of the particular sport. Sport-specific training routines also often include variations to both free weight and machine movements that may not be common for traditional weightlifting.

Though weight training can stimulate the [[cardiovascular system]], many exercise [[physiologist]]s, based on their observation of maximal [[oxygen]] uptake, argue that [[aerobics]] training is a better cardiovascular stimulus. Central [[catheter]] monitoring during resistance training reveals increased [[cardiac output]], suggesting that strength training shows potential for [[cardiovascular exercise]]. However, a 2007 meta-analysis found that, though aerobic training is an effective therapy for heart failure patients, combined aerobic and strength training is ineffective; "the favorable antiremodeling role of aerobic exercise was not confirmed when this mode of exercise was combined with strength training".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haykowsky |first1=Mark J. |last2=Liang |first2=Yuanyuan |last3=Pechter |first3=David |last4=Jones |first4=Lee W. |last5=McAlister |first5=Finlay A. |last6=Clark |first6=Alexander M. |title=A Meta-Analysis of the Effect of Exercise Training on Left Ventricular Remodeling in Heart Failure Patients |journal=Journal of the American College of Cardiology |date=June 2007 |volume=49 |issue=24 |pages=2329–2336 |doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2007.02.055 |pmid=17572248 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One side-effect of any intense exercise is increased levels of [[dopamine]], [[serotonin]] and [[norepinephrine]], which can help to improve mood and counter feelings of [[depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/exercise-depression|title=Exercise and Depression|work=WebMD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weight training has also been shown to benefit dieters as it inhibits lean body mass loss (as opposed to fat loss) when under a caloric deficit. Weight training also strengthens bones, helping to prevent bone loss and [[osteoporosis]]. By increasing muscular strength and improving balance, weight training can also reduce falls by elderly persons. Weight training is also attracting attention for the benefits it can have on the brain, and in older adults, a 2017 meta analysis found that it was effective in improving cognitive performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Northey |first1=Joseph Michael |last2=Cherbuin |first2=Nicolas |last3=Pumpa |first3=Kate Louise |last4=Smee |first4=Disa Jane |last5=Rattray |first5=Ben |title=Exercise interventions for cognitive function in adults older than 50: a systematic review with meta-analysis |journal=British Journal of Sports Medicine |date=February 2018 |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=154–160 |doi=10.1136/bjsports-2016-096587 |pmid=28438770 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weight training and other types of strength training==
The benefits of weight training overall are comparable to most other types of strength training: increased muscle, tendon and ligament strength, bone density, flexibility, tone, metabolic rate, and postural support. This type of training will also help prevent injury for athletes. There are benefits and limitations to weight training as compared to other types of strength training. Contrary to popular belief, weight training can be beneficial for both men and women.

===Weight training and bodybuilding===
Although weight training is similar to [[bodybuilding]], they have different objectives. Bodybuilders use weight training to develop their muscles for size, shape, and symmetry regardless of any increase in strength for competition in bodybuilding contests; they train to maximize their muscular size and develop extremely low levels of [[adipose tissue|body fat]]. In contrast, many weight trainers train to improve their strength and anaerobic endurance while not giving special attention to reducing body fat far below normal.

The bodybuilding community has been the source of many weight training principles, techniques, vocabulary, and customs. Weight training does allow tremendous flexibility in exercises and weights which can allow bodybuilders to target specific muscles and muscle groups, as well as attain specific goals. Not all bodybuilding is undertaken to compete in bodybuilding contests and, in fact, the vast majority of bodybuilders never compete, but bodybuild for their own personal reasons.&lt;sup&gt;[Citation Needed]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Complex training===
In [[complex training]], weight training is typically combined with plyometric exercises in an alternating sequence. Ideally, the weight lifting exercise and the plyometric exercise should move through similar ranges of movement i.e. a back squat at 85-95% [[1RM]] followed by a vertical jump. An advantage of this form of training is that it allows the intense activation of the nervous system and increased muscle fibre recruitment from the weight lifting exercise to be utilized in the subsequent plyometric exercise; thereby improving the power with which it can be performed. Over a period of training, this may enhance the athlete's ability to apply power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Steven J | last1 = Fleck | first2 = William J | last2 = Kraemer | name-list-style = vanc | chapter = Complex Training, or Contrast Loading | title =Designing Resistance Training Programmes | publisher = Human Kinetics | location = Leeds | date = 2013 | page = 253 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plyometric exercise may be replaced with a sports specific action. The intention being to utilize the neural and muscular activation from the heavy lift in the sports specific action, in order to be able to perform it more powerfully. Over a period of training this may enhance the athlete's ability to perform that sports specific action more powerfully, without a precursory heavy lift being required.

===Ballistic training===
[[Ballistic training]] incorporates weight training in such a way that the acceleration phase of the movement is maximized and the deceleration phase minimized; thereby increasing the power of the movement overall. For example, throwing a weight or jumping whilst holding a weight. This can be contrasted with a standard weight lifting exercise where there is a distinct deceleration phase at the end of the repetition which stops the weight from moving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Steven J | last1 = Fleck | first2 = William J | last2 = Kraemer | name-list-style = vanc | chapter = Ballistic Training | title = Designing Resistance Training Programmes | publisher = Human Kinetics | location = Leeds | date = 2013 | page = 280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contrast loading===
Contrast loading is the alternation of heavy and light loads. Considered as sets, the heavy load is performed at about 85-95% 1 repetition max; the light load should be considerably lighter at about 30-60% [[1RM]]. Both sets should be performed fast with the lighter set being performed as fast as possible. The joints should not be locked as this inhibits muscle fibre recruitment and reduces the speed at which the exercise can be performed. The lighter set may be a [[Plyometrics#Loaded plyometrics|loaded plyometric]] exercise such as  loaded squat jumps or jumps with a trap bar.

Similarly to complex training, contrast loading relies upon the enhanced activation of the nervous system and increased muscle fibre recruitment from the heavy set, to allow the lighter set to be performed more powerfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McGuigan | first = Mike | name-list-style = vanc | chapter = Contrast Training | title = Developing Power | location = Leeds | publisher = Human Kinetics | date = 2017 | pages = 196–197 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a physiological effect is commonly referred to as post-activation potentiation, or the PAP effect. Contrast loading can effectively demonstrate the PAP effect: if a light weight is lifted, and then a heavy weight is lifted, and then the same light weight is lifted again, then the light weight will feel lighter the second time it has been lifted. This is due to the enhanced PAP effect which occurs as a result of the heavy lift being utilised in the subsequent lighter lift; thus making the weight feel lighter and allowing the lift to be performed more powerfully.

===Weight training versus isometric training===
{{See also|Isometric exercise}}
[[Isometric exercise]] provides a maximum amount of resistance based on the force output of the muscle, or muscles pitted against one another. This maximum force maximally strengthens the muscles over all of the joint angles at which the isometric exercise occurs. By comparison, weight training also strengthens the muscle throughout the [[range of motion]] the [[joint]] is trained in, but only maximally at one angle, causing a lesser increase in physical strength at other angles from the initial through terminating joint angle as compared with isometric exercise. In addition, the risk of injury from weights used in weight training is greater than with isometric exercise (no weights), and the risk of asymmetric training is also greater than with isometric exercise of identical opposing muscles.

The '''burpee''', a [[squat thrust]] with an additional stand between reps, is a full body exercise used in [[strength training]]. The movement itself is primarily an [[anaerobic exercise]], but when done in succession over a longer period can be utilized in as an [[aerobic exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=International Standards for the 3‐Minute Burpee Test: High‐ Intensity Motor Performance |date=19 October 2019 |pmc=6815084 |last1=Podstawski |first1=R. |last2=Markowski |first2=P. |last3=Clark |first3=C.

The basic movement is performed in four steps and known as a "four-count burpee":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130104/new-york-city/real-story-behind-exercise-you-love-hate-burpee |title=The Real Story Behind the Exercise You Love to Hate: The Burpee |publisher=DNA Info |author=Sheryl Dluginski |date=January 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818135031/https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20130104/new-york-city/real-story-behind-exercise-you-love-hate-burpee |archive-date=August 18, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
NOTE: These standards are from the sources that state the origin of the original Burpee. All other varieties, including those popular in CrossFit and similar programs with further ranges of motion, are listed below.--&gt;
# Begin in a standing position.
# Move into a [[Squat (exercise)|squat]] position with your hands on the ground. (count 1)
# Kick your feet back into an [[Plank_(exercise)|extended plank]] position, while keeping your arms extended.  (count 2)
# Immediately return your feet into squat position. (count 3)
# Stand up from the squat position (count 4)  

Moves 2 through 4 constitute a [[squat thrust]].

==Origin==
The exercise was named in the 1930s for US [[physiologist]] Royal H. Burpee, who developed the ''burpee test''; he earned a PhD in [[applied physiology]] from [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] in 1940 and created the "burpee" exercise as part of his PhD thesis as a quick and simple way to assess fitness.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pk.tc.columbia.edu/item/Seven-Quickly-Administered-Tests-Of-Physical-Capacity-And-Their-Use-In-Detecting-Physical-Incapacity-For-Motor-Activity-In-Men-And-Boys-51865 |title=Reference extract from Teachers College, Columbia University archive |publisher=Teachers College, Columbia University |access-date=8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exercise was popularized when the United States Armed Services adopted it as a way to assess the fitness level of recruits when the US entered [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. Consisting of a series of the exercises performed in rapid succession, the test was meant to be a quick measure of agility, coordination, and strength.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/burpee |title=Definition of burpee  |work=[[Oxford Dictionaries Online]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High-intensity interval training''' ('''HIIT'''), also called '''high-intensity intermittent exercise''' ('''HIIE''') or '''sprint interval training''' ('''SIT'''), is a form of [[interval training]], a [[cardiovascular exercise]] strategy alternating short periods of intense [[anaerobic exercise]] with less intense recovery periods, until too exhausted to continue. Though there is no universal HIIT session duration, these intense workouts typically last under 30 minutes, with times varying based on a participant's current fitness level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dohiit.com/hiit-faq/#What_is_High-Intensity_Interval_Training|title=HIIT FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions about High-Intensity Interval Training)|work=DOHIIT|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intensity of HIIT also depends on the duration of the session. 

HIIT workouts provide improved athletic capacity and [[physical exercise|condition]] as well as improved [[carbohydrate metabolism|glucose metabolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Laursen PB, Jenkins DG |title=The Scientific Basis for High-Intensity Interval Training|journal=Sports Medicine|volume=32|issue=1|pages=53–73|date=2002|pmid=11772161|doi=10.2165/00007256-200232010-00003|s2cid=19061181|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with longer sessions typical of other regimens, HIIT may not be as effective for treating [[hyperlipidemia]] and [[obesity]], or improving muscle and bone mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Nybo|first1=Lars|last2=Sundstrup|first2=Emil|last3=Jakobsen|first3=Markus D.|last4=Mohr|first4=Magni|last5=Hornstrup|first5=Therese|last6=Simonsen|first6=Lene|last7=Bülow|first7=Jens|last8=Randers|first8=Morten B.|last9=Nielsen|first9=Jens J.|date=2010-10-01|title=High-intensity training versus traditional exercise interventions for promoting health|journal=Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise|volume=42|issue=10|pages=1951–1958|doi=10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181d99203|issn=1530-0315|pmid=20195181|s2cid=15209524|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/eede8f3f90453ae1a1e9d8e81cacb890081c1d0a}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research has shown that HIIT regimens produced significant reductions in the fat mass of the whole-body in young women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Haifeng|last2=Tong|first2=Tom K.|last3=Qiu|first3=Weifeng|last4=Zhang|first4=Xu|last5=Zhou|first5=Shi|last6=Liu|first6=Yang|last7=He|first7=Yuxiu|date=2017-01-01|title=Comparable Effects of High-Intensity Interval Training and Prolonged Continuous Exercise Training on Abdominal Visceral Fat Reduction in Obese Young Women|journal=Journal of Diabetes Research|language=en|volume=2017|pages=5071740|doi=10.1155/2017/5071740|issn=2314-6745|pmc=5237463|pmid=28116314}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some researchers also note that HIIT requires "an extremely high level of subject motivation" and question whether the general population could safely or practically tolerate the extreme nature of the exercise regimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gibala MJ|title=High-intensity Interval Training: A Time-efficient Strategy for Health Promotion?|journal=Current Sports Med Rep|volume=6|issue=4|pages=211–13|date=July 2007|pmid=17617995|doi=10.1007/s11932-007-0033-8|s2cid=27099468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
HIIT exercise sessions generally consist of a [[Warming up|warm up period]] followed by repetitions of high-intensity exercises separated by medium intensity exercises for recovery, then a cool down period. The high-intensity exercise should be done at near maximum intensity. The medium exercise should be about 50% intensity. The number of repetitions and length of each depends on the exercise, but may be as little as three repetitions with just 20 seconds of intense exercise.&lt;ref name="NYT Well Blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/one-minute-workout/|title=Got a Minute? Let's Work Out}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific exercises performed during the high-intensity portions vary. Most of the research on HIIT has been done using a cycling ergometer, but other exercises like a rowing ergometer, running, stair climbing and uphill walking can also be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gillen|first1=Jenna B.|last2=Gibala|first2=Martin J.|date=2013-09-27|title=Is high-intensity interval training a time-efficient exercise strategy to improve health and fitness?|journal=Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism|volume=39|issue=3|pages=409–412|doi=10.1139/apnm-2013-0187|pmid=24552392|issn=1715-5312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no specific formula to HIIT. Depending on one's level of cardiovascular development, the moderate-level intensity can be as slow as walking. A common formula involves a 2:1 ratio of work to recovery periods, for example, 30–40 seconds of hard sprinting alternated with 15–20 seconds of jogging or walking, repeated to failure.

The entire HIIT session may last between four and thirty minutes, meaning that it is considered to be an excellent way to maximize a workout that is limited by time constraints.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/10/20/exercise-workout-shorter-forbeslife-cx_avd_1020health.html|title=Ten ways to get more from your workout|work=Forbes|date=October 20, 2008|access-date=December 14, 2008|author=Van Dusen, Allison}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Use of a clock or timer is recommended to keep accurate times, the number of rounds, and intensity.

===Peter Coe regimen===
A type of high-intensity interval training with short recovery periods was used in the 1970s by the athletics coach [[Peter Coe]] when setting sessions for his son [[Sebastian Coe]]. Inspired by the principles propounded by the German coach and university professor [[Woldemar Gerschler]] and the Swedish physiologist [[Per-Olof Åstrand]], Coe set sessions involving repeated fast 200 metre runs with only 30 seconds recovery between each fast run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Sebastian|last=Coe|title=Running My Life|publisher=Hodder|year=2013|isbn=978-1-444-73253-5|pages=38, 39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tabata regimen===
A version of HIIT was based on a 1996 study&lt;ref name="pmid8897392"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8897392 |doi=10.1097/00005768-199610000-00018|title=Effects of moderate-intensity endurance and high-intensity intermittent training on anaerobic capacity and VO2max|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|volume=28|issue=10|pages=1327–1330|year=1996|last1=Tabata|first1=Izumi|last2=Nishimura|first2=Kouji|last3=Kouzaki|first3=Motoki|last4=Hirai|first4=Yuusuke|last5=Ogita|first5=Futoshi|last6=Miyachi|first6=Motohiko|last7=Yamamoto|first7=Kaoru|s2cid=11974355|url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5f90/dcc82933b2300a47d6acb859d74089a25e0c.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Ritsumeikan University]] Professor [[Izumi Tabata]] (田畑泉) et al. initially involving [[speedskating|Olympic speedskaters]]. The study used 20&amp;nbsp;seconds of ultra-intense exercise (at an intensity of about 170% of [[VO2 max|VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max]]) followed by 10&amp;nbsp;seconds of rest, repeated continuously for 4&amp;nbsp;minutes (8 cycles). The exercise was performed on a mechanically braked [[cycle ergometer]]. Tabata called this '''the IE1 protocol'''.&lt;ref name="pmid9139179"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9139179 |doi=10.1097/00005768-199703000-00015|title=Metabolic profile of high intensity intermittent exercises|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|volume=29|issue=3|pages=390–395|year=1997|last1=Tabata|first1=Izumi|last2=Irisawa|first2=Kouichi|last3=Kouzaki|first3=Motoki|last4=Nishimura|first4=Kouji|last5=Ogita|first5=Futoshi|last6=Miyachi|first6=Motohiko|s2cid=13754142|url=http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f47c/1114865c7257658ad6be27141e0b0d4094bb.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the original study, athletes using this method trained 4 times per week, plus another day of steady-state training, for 6 weeks and obtained gains similar to a group of athletes who did [[Continuous training|steady state training]] (70% VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max) 5 times per week. The steady state group had a higher VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max at the end (from 52 to 57&amp;nbsp;mL/(kg•min)). However the Tabata group had achieved comparable aerobic improvements but only exercised 4 minutes per day on their 4 HIIT days compared to 60 minutes for the aerobic group. The Tabata group also started lower and gained more overall (from 48 to 55&amp;nbsp;mL/(kg•min)). Also, only the Tabata group had gained [[Anaerobic exercise|anaerobic capacity]] benefits. 

In popular culture, "Tabata training" has now come to refer to a wide variety of HIIT protocols and exercise regimens &lt;ref name=tabataexercises&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beginner's Guide To Tabata Workouts|url=https://noobnorm.com/beginners-guide-to-tabata-workouts/#best-tabata-exercises|publisher=Noob Norm|access-date=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may or may not have similar benefits to those found in Tabata's original study.

===Gibala regimen===
Professor Martin Gibala and his  team at [[McMaster University]] in Canada have been researching high-intensity exercise for several years. Their 2010 study on students&lt;ref name=pmid20100740&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20100740 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2009.181743|title=A practical model of low-volume high-intensity interval training induces mitochondrial biogenesis in human skeletal muscle: Potential mechanisms|journal=The Journal of Physiology|volume=588|issue=6|pages=1011–22|year=2010|last1=Little|first1=J. P.|last2=Safdar|first2=A.|last3=Wilkin|first3=G. P.|last4=Tarnopolsky|first4=M. A.|last5=Gibala|first5=M. J.|pmc=2849965}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses 3 minutes for warming up, then  60 seconds of intense exercise (at 95% of VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max) followed by 75 seconds of rest, repeated for 8–12 cycles (sometimes referred to as "The Little Method"). Subjects using this method training 3 times per week obtained gains similar to what would be expected from subjects who did steady state (50–70% VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;max) training five times per week. While still a demanding form of training, this exercise protocol could be used by the general public with nothing more than an average exercise bike.

Gibala's group published a less intense version of their regimen in a 2011 paper in ''[[Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise]]''. This was intended as a gentler option for sedentary people who had done no exercise for over a year. It included 3 minutes of warm-up, 10 repetitions of 60-second bursts at 60% peak power (80–95% of [[Heart rate#Heart rate reserve|heart rate reserve]]) each followed by 60 seconds of recovery, and then a 5-minute cool-down.&lt;ref name=Hood2011&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=21448086 |doi=10.1249/MSS.0b013e3182199834|title=Low-Volume Interval Training Improves Muscle Oxidative Capacity in Sedentary Adults|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise|volume=43|issue=10|pages=1849–56|year=2011|last1=Hood|first1=Melanie S.|last2=Little|first2=Jonathan P.|last3=Tarnopolsky|first3=Mark A.|last4=Myslik|first4=Frank|last5=Gibala|first5=Martin J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zuniga regimen===
Jorge Zuniga, assistant professor of exercise science at [[Creighton University]], set out to determine how to fit the highest volume of work and oxygen consumption into the smallest amount of time.  He found that intervals of 30 seconds at 90% of power output at VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max followed by 30 seconds of rest allowed for the highest VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption and the longest workout duration at specified intensity.  Alternative protocols considered included 100% of maximum power output on the same interval schedule, similar to the Coe regimen, and 90% of maximum power output for three minutes, similar to traditional interval training.&lt;ref name=Zuniga&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zuniga JM, Berg K, Noble J, Harder J, Chaffin ME, Hanumanthu VS |title=Physiological responses during interval training with different intensities and duration of exercise|journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research|volume=25|issue=5|pages=1279–84|date=May 2011|pmid=21522072|doi=10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181d681b6|s2cid=13700291|type=Primary Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zuniga's protocol has been implemented with great success by students of his who were participating in Creighton's Army [[ROTC]] program.  Cadets completing the protocol twice a week saw greater improvements in [[United States Army Physical Fitness Test|APFT]] scores than in years past.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Vollaard regimen===
Dr Niels Vollaard at the [[University of Stirling]] proposed that when high-intensity intervals are done at ‘all-out’ intensities, associated health benefits plateau after performing 2 or 3 sprint repetitions. This led to the development of a 10-minute exercise routine consisting of easy pedalling interspersed with two 20-second ‘all-out’ cycling sprints.&lt;ref name=Metcalfe&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Metcalfe RS, Babraj JA, Fawkner SG, Vollaard NB|title=Towards the minimal amount of exercise for improving metabolic health: beneficial effects of reduced-exertion high-intensity interval training|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|volume=112|issue=7|pages=2767–75|date=Jul 2012|pmid=22124524|doi=10.1007/s00421-011-2254-z|type=Primary Article|hdl=1893/24960|s2cid=6095493|url=http://opus.bath.ac.uk/27674/3/Metcalfe_et_al_2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2017 meta-analysis, Vollaard indeed showed that common protocols with as many as 6 to 10 repetitions of 30-second ‘all-out’ sprints do not improve aerobic fitness more than the ‘2x20-s’ protocol.&lt;ref name=Vollaard&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Vollaard NB, Metcalfe RS, Williams S|title=Effect of Number of Sprints in an SIT Session on Change in VO2max: A Meta-analysis|journal=Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise|volume=49|issue=6|pages=1147–1156|date=Jun 2017|pmid=28079707|doi=10.1249/MSS.0000000000001204|s2cid=12761455|type=Primary Article|url=https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa35658}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is claimed that this short protocol may remove many of the drawbacks that make other high-intensity interval training protocols unsuitable for the general population.&lt;ref name="Vollaard/Metcalfe"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Vollaard NB, Metcalfe RS|title=Research into the Health Benefits of Sprint Interval Training Should Focus on Protocols with Fewer and Shorter Sprints|journal=Sports Medicine|date=Apr 2017|pmid=28391489|doi=10.1007/s40279-017-0727-x|type=Primary Article|volume=47|issue=12|pmc=5684281|pages=2443–2451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a BBC ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' programme in February 2012, Jamie Timmons, professor of systems biology at the [[University of Loughborough]], put [[Michael Mosley (BBC)|Michael Mosley]] through this exercise bike regimen, but with three sprints instead of two. This was done three times a week for a total of 30 minutes of exercise per week (3 minutes of intense exercise), plus warm-up and recovery time.

==Regimen comparison==
Wood et al. compared high-intensity interval training of eight 1-minute bouts at 85% maximum Watts (Wmax), interspersed with a 1-minute active recovery at 25% Wmax with sprint interval training of eight 30-second bouts at 130% Wmax, interspersed with 90-second active recovery at 25% Wmax. (Total time matched at 24 minutes including warm up &amp; cool down). Their conclusion was "HIIT is the recommended routine" but "the magnitude of differences in various parameters between regimens was small; therefore, preference for either modality may be up to the individual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1519/JSC.0000000000001042 |pmid=26691413 |title=Dissimilar Physiological and Perceptual Responses Between Sprint Interval Training and High-Intensity Interval Training |journal=Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=244–50 |year=2016 |last1=Wood |first1=Kimberly M. |last2=Olive |first2=Brittany |last3=Lavalle |first3=Kaylyn |last4=Thompson |first4=Heather |last5=Greer |first5=Kevin |last6=Astorino |first6=Todd A. |s2cid=41754265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==

===Cardiovascular effects===
A 2015 [[systematic review]] and meta-analysis of [[randomized controlled trial]]s found that HIIT training and traditional endurance training both lead to significantly improved [[cardiovascular fitness]] in healthy adults ages 18–45 but greater improvements in VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max were seen in those participating in the HIIT exercise regimen.&lt;ref name=Milanovic2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Milanović Z, Sporiš G, Weston M |title=Effectiveness of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIT) and Continuous Endurance Training for VO2max Improvements: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Controlled Trials|journal=Sports Med|volume=45|issue=10|pages=1469–81|date=October 2015|pmid=26243014|doi=10.1007/s40279-015-0365-0|s2cid=41092016|type=Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|url=https://research.tees.ac.uk/en/publications/b8acba8c-2392-4da5-b095-cd2ab46fc5e0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another analysis also found that HIIT regimens of one month or longer effectively improve cardiovascular fitness in adolescents and lead to moderate improvements in body composition.&lt;ref name=Costigan2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Costigan SA, Eather N, Plotnikoff RC, Taaffe DR, Lubans DR |title=High-intensity interval training for improving health-related fitness in adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Br J Sports Med|volume=49|issue=19|pages=1253–61|date=October 2015|pmid=26089322|doi=10.1136/bjsports-2014-094490|s2cid=20142453|type=Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|hdl=1959.13/1339333|hdl-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a separate systematic review and meta-analysis of seven small randomized controlled trials found that HIIT (defined as four intervals of four minutes at 85–95% of max heart rate with three-minute intervals at 60–70% of max heart rate) was more effective than moderate-intensity continuous training at improving blood vessel function and markers of blood vessel health.&lt;ref name=Ramos2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ramos JS, Dalleck LC, Tjonna AE, Beetham KS, Coombes JS |title=The impact of high-intensity interval training versus moderate-intensity continuous training on vascular function: a systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Sports Med|volume=45|issue=5|pages=679–92|date=May 2015|pmid=25771785|doi=10.1007/s40279-015-0321-z|s2cid=6918612|type=Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brain power ===
A 2017 study examined the effect of HIIT on cognitive performance among a group of children (N=318).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moreau D, Kirk IJ, Waldie, KE | title = High-intensity training enhances executive function in children in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial | journal = eLife | volume = 6:e25062 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28825973 | pmc = 5566451| doi = 10.7554/eLife.25062 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors show that HIIT is beneficial to cognitive control and working memory capacity when compared against "a blend of board games, computer games, and trivia quizzes" and that this effect is mediated by the [[Brain-derived neurotrophic factor|BDNF]] polymorphism. They conclude that the study "suggests a promising alternative to enhance cognition, via short and potent exercise regimens".

      <text bytes="6086" xml:space="preserve">In [[bodybuilding]] and [[weight training]], using '''drop sets''' (aka '''dropsets''', '''descending sets''', '''strip sets''', the '''multi-poundage system''' the '''stripping method''', '''triple-drops''', '''down the rack''', or '''running the rack''')&lt;ref name="bodybuilding"/&gt; is a technique for continuing an [[exercise]] with a lower weight once [[muscle]] failure has been achieved at a higher weight.&lt;ref name="evans-2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wubben-2008"/&gt; It is most often performed on [[weight machine]]s because reducing the weight quickly is thought by some to be extremely important, but it can also be performed with [[dumbbell]]s and other [[Wrist weights|free weights]].

==History==
The approach of reducing resistance during sets was described in the late 1940s by Henry Atkins, editor of Body Culture magazine, who called it the '''multi-poundage system'''.&lt;ref name="bodybuilding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atkins-1949-transcript"/&gt;

In the 1980s, drop sets formed part of [[Joe Weider]]'s ''Weider System''.&lt;ref name="bodybuilding"/&gt;

While performing a [[biceps curl]], the person lifting the weight would start with a 25 [[pound (mass)|pound]] dumbbell and do as many repetitions as possible without significantly compromising form.  Then a 20-pound weight would be used until exhaustion is reached. One could continue to "drop" down as many times as they wish, but usually the weight is not dropped to below fifty percent of his/her one rep maximum.

==Variations==
There are many variations possible while using the same basic concept of reducing the weight used.  One way is to do a specified number of repetitions at each weight (without necessarily reaching the point of [[Training to failure|muscle failure]]) with an increase in the number of repetitions each time the weight is reduced.  The amount or percentage of weight reduced at each step is also one aspect of the method with much variety.  A '''wide drop set''' method is one in which a large percentage (usually 30% or more) of the starting weight is shed with each weight reduction.  A '''tight drop set''' would remove anywhere from 10% to 25%. These definitions are somewhat arbitrary, of course, and not everyone will agree on the exact definitions.

==Effects==
In adults in their 50s, 12 weeks of drop-set training conducted thrice-weekly can improve muscle mass, muscle strength, muscle endurance and tasks of functionality.&lt;ref name="johannsmeyer-2016"/&gt;

Drop set usage can increase the hypertrophic response to resistance training.&lt;ref name="fink-2017"/&gt;

Some researchers have reported mixed or inconclusive findings.&lt;ref name="schoenfeld-2017"/&gt;

==Cautions==
{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2018}}
As it is very easy to "over train" with drop sets {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}, it is highly recommended that no more than one to two drop sets be done per muscle group on any given workout.  This technique is also not recommended as a long term regimen.  The primary focus on drop setting is to "shock" the muscles by adding stress, thus incentivizing additional [[muscular hypertrophy|hypertrophy]].

==Other names==
Drop sets and the technique also go by the names '''breakdowns''', '''burnouts''', '''descending sets''', '''triple-drops''' (when a total of three different weights are used), '''down the rack''' or '''running the rack''' (when using dumbbells), '''up the stack''' (because with a weight machine, the pin is moved up the stack of plates with each drop in weight), '''strip sets''' (when you "strip" weights off the ends of a bar), or the '''stripping technique''' (so called because of "stripping" weight plates off with each drop in weight).

A '''negative repetition''' ('''negative rep''') is the repetition of a technique in [[weight training|weight lifting]] in which the lifter performs the [[Eccentric training|eccentric phase]] of a lift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of Eccentric Weight Training|url = http://weighttraining.about.com/od/glossary/g/eccentric.htm|accessdate = 2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of pressing the weight up slowly, in proper form, a [[Spotting (weight training)|spotter]] generally aids in the concentric, or lifting, portion of the repetition while the lifter slowly performs the eccentric phase for 3–6 seconds. Negative reps are used to improve both [[Physical strength|muscular strength]] and power in subjects, this is commonly known as hypertrophy training.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2020-01-24|title=Hypertrophy Training vs. Strength Training: Pros and Cons of Each|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/exercise-fitness/hypertrophy-vs-strength|access-date=2021-02-17|website=Healthline|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its mechanical properties, this form of training can be used for both healthy individuals and individuals who are in rehabilitation. Studies have shown that negative repetitions or "[[Eccentric training|eccentric phase training]]" combines a high amount of force on the muscle with a lower energy cost than normal concentric training, which requires 4–5 times the amount of energy. This justifies why this type of training is more beneficial and less of a risk to subjects rehabilitating or with a limited exercise capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Eccentric exercise training: modalities, applications and perspectives|date = 2013|journal = Sports Medicine|doi = 10.1007/s40279-013-0052-y|pmid = 23657934|volume=43 |issue = 6|pages=483–512|last1 = Isner-Horobeti|first1 = Marie-Eve|last2 = Dufour|first2 = Stéphane Pascal|last3 = Vautravers|first3 = Philippe|last4 = Geny|first4 = Bernard|last5 = Coudeyre|first5 = Emmanuel|last6 = Richard|first6 = Ruddy|s2cid = 2678369}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Eccentric training is often associated with the terms "muscles soreness" and "muscle damage". In 1902, [[Theodore Hough]] discovered and developed the term DOMS ([[delayed onset muscle soreness]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://breakingmuscle.com/strength-conditioning/doms-the-good-the-bad-and-what-it-really-means-to-your-training|title = DOMS: the good, the bad and what it really means to your training|date = |accessdate = |website = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; after he found that exercises containing negative repetitions caused athletes to have sore muscles. Hough believed this was causing a rupture within the muscle; when he looked further into the subject, he found that when performing eccentric exercise that exhibited soreness, the muscle "quickly adapts and becomes accustomed to the increase in applied stress".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mc.uky.edu/athletic_training/docs/nzsmsc-2010/Eccentric_Training_Spring2011.pdf|title = Eccentric training|date = |accessdate = |website = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of this was that the muscles' soreness not only decreased, but the muscular damage did too.

== Health benefits for the elderly ==
It has been proven that eccentric resistance training improves the functional mobility of older adults. Studies have shown that eccentric training of the lower body, in particular the [[:Category:Knee extensors|knee extensors]], are essential in preventing falls in older adults and helping them maintain their independence. A study conducted focusing on eccentric training for the age group 65–87 years of age showed that, over 12 weeks, they had strengthened their knee extensors by up to 26%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gault | first=Mandy | title=Aging, Functional Capacity and Eccentric Exercise Training | journal=Aging and Disease | volume=4 | issue=6 | date=November 1, 2013 | issn=2152-5250 | pmid=24307968 | pmc=3843652 | doi=10.14336/ad.2013.0400351 | pages=351–363}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this evidence, it is reasonable to suggest that negative repetitions can help improve the health of older adults.

== Treatment of Tendinopathy ==
Studies have shown that eccentric training may be successful in the treatment of certain [[Tendinitis|tendonitis]]. Studies have shown that the use of eccentric training for twelve weeks may be an alternative to therapy for people suffering from [[Patellar tendinitis|Patellar Tendinopathy]] (Jumper's Knee).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Surgical Treatment Compared with Eccentric Training for Patellar Tendinopathy (Jumper's Knee)|url = http://jbjs.org/content/88/8/1689|journal = The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery|date = 2006-08-01|access-date = 2015-04-16|issn = 0021-9355|pmid = 16882889|pages = 1689–1698|volume = 88|issue = 8|doi = 10.2106/JBJS.E.01181|first1 = Roald|last1 = Bahr|first2 = Bjørn|last2 = Fossan|first3 = Sverre|last3 = Løken|first4 = Lars|last4 = Engebretsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eccentric training has also been proven successful in the treatment of chronic [[Achilles tendinitis|Achilles tendonitis]], using a twelve-week eccentric calf muscle program various studies have shown the ability for people to return to normal pre-tendonitis levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chronic Achilles tendon pain treated with eccentric calf-muscle training|journal = Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy|date = 2003-08-26|issn = 0942-2056|pages = 327–333|volume = 11|issue = 5|doi = 10.1007/s00167-003-0418-z|first1 = Martin|last1 = Fahlström|first2 = Per|last2 = Jonsson|first3 = Ronny|last3 = Lorentzon|first4 = Håkan|last4 = Alfredson|pmid=12942235|s2cid = 4064152}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Eccentric overload training for patients with chronic Achilles tendon pain - a randomised controlled study with reliability testing of the evaluation methods| doi=10.1034/j.1600-0838.2001.110402.x| pmid=11476424|volume=11| issue=4|journal= Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports|pages=197–206|year = 2001|last1 = Gravare Silbernagel|first1 = K.| last2=Thomee| first2=R.| last3=Thomee| first3=P.| last4=Karlsson| first4=J.| s2cid=36942476}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasoning behind the benefits of eccentric training for tendinopathy is still unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Clinical improvement after 6 weeks of eccentric exercise in patients with mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy – a randomized trial with 1-year follow-up |journal = Scand J Med Sci Sports|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0838.2004.378.x|volume=14|issue = 5 |pages=286–295|pmid=15387802|date=October 2004 | last1 = Roos | first1 = EM | last2 = Engström | first2 = M | last3 = Lagerquist | first3 = A | last4 = Söderberg | first4 = B|s2cid = 6682148|url = http://lup.lub.lu.se/record/127202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="17667" xml:space="preserve">A '''fitness boot camp''' is a type of group [[physical training]] program that may be conducted by [[gym]]s, [[personal trainer]]s or other organizations. These programs are designed to build strength and fitness through a variety of types of [[exercise]]. The activities and format may be loosely modeled on aspects of fitness training used in the military and the trainers themselves may be former [[military personnel]].  

Indoor and outdoor boot camp workouts became popular in the United States in the late 1990s. Fitness boot camps as outdoor group fitness classes grew in popularity in the 2000s. These originated independently in Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.

The LinkedIn profile cited mentions a "Corporate fitness and wellness education and facilitation" business from 1993 to 2008 that included "corporate fitness boot camps and outdoor exercise", but the main activity of this business is not described as a fitness boot camp and the concept of an [[Outward Bound]] course had existed since 1941 in the United Kingdom.|group=nb}} the United Kingdom in 1999 ([[British Military Fitness]]),&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://startups.co.uk/british-military-fitness-robin-cope/|title=British Military Fitness: Robin Cope|date=24 August 2011|work=Startups|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.coachmag.co.uk/fitness/5774/british-military-fitness-co-founder-harry-sowerby|title=British Military Fitness Co-Founder Harry Sowerby|date=20 September 2016|work=Coach|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.easyresettlement.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/ER_Magazine_Autumn_2013SP.pdf|title=Fit For Role – Careers in Health and Fitness|date=Autumn 2013|website=Easy Resettlement|pages=14–15|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canada in 2001 (The Original Boot Camp).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0EmCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246|title=The Planet Friendly Diet: Your 21-Day Guide to Sustainable Weight Loss and Optimal Health|last=Smiley|first=Cat|date=2015-12-14|publisher=New Society Publishers|isbn=9781550926088|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outdoor group fitness classes such as these have been growing in popularity ever since and have become a distinct commercial market within the fitness industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.healthclubmanagement.co.uk/health-club-management-news/Active-IQ-outdoor-fitness-qualification-training/324606?source=search|title=Active IQ unveils new outdoor fitness qualification|date=2017-06-10|work=Health Club Management|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.healthclubmanagement.co.uk/health-club-management-news/BMF-first-to-receive-ukactive-Outdoor-Code-of-Practice-certification/313546?source=search|title=BMF first to receive ukactive Outdoor Code of Practice certification|date=2015-01-20|work=Health Club Management|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/14/out-of-the-gyms-and-into-the-streets-why-is-fitness-such-a-fascinating-public-spectacle|title=We can't look away: the guilt-inducing spectacle of outdoor fitness|date=2018-08-14|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2018-10-07|last1=Lee|first1=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://brandwavemarketing.com/fitness-industry-outdoor-industry/|title=What can the fitness industry learn from the outdoor industry?|date=2017-09-19|website=Brandwave Marketing|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the television series [[Boot Camp (TV series)|Boot Camp]] aired in 2001. In the United Kingdom, [[reality television]] program [[Celebrity Fit Club]], which involved boot camp-style fitness, aired from 2002–2006. The series was brought over to the United States in 2005 as [[Celebrity Fit Club (U.S. TV series)|Celebrity Fit Club]] which aired until 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Boot camp training often commences with dynamic [[stretching]] and [[running]], followed by a wide variety of [[interval training]], including lifting weights/objects, pulling rubber [[suspension training|TRX straps]], pushups/situps, [[plyometrics]], and various types of intense explosive routines. Sessions usually finish with [[yoga stretching]]. Many other exercises using [[weight training|weights]] and/or bodyweight, similar to [[CrossFit]] routines, are used to lose [[body fat]], increase [[cardiovascular]] efficiency, increase [[Physical strength|strength]], and help people get into a routine of regular [[exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Monge, Stefanie|title=Fitness boot camps are a big business in Omaha|url=http://callcenterinfo.tmcnet.com/news/2008/01/09/3202025.htm|work=[[Omaha World-Herald]]|date=January 9, 2008|accessdate=May 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many programs offer [[nutrition]] advice as well. It is called "boot camp" because it trains groups of people, may be outdoors and may involve physical training similar to that used by the military or activities borrowed from [[military basic training]].

The term "''boot camp''" is currently used in the fitness industry to describe group fitness classes that promote fat loss, [[camaraderie]], and team effort. They are designed to push people a little bit further than they would normally push themselves in the gym alone. Boot Camps are sometimes organized outdoors in [[park]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karen, Matthews|title=Open-air exercise: Fitness boot camps hit the parks|url=http://www.eagletribune.com/pulife/local_story_168093853?keyword=secondarystory|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[The Eagle-Tribune]]|date=June 17, 2007|accessdate=May 11, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 1, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601122401/http://www.eagletribune.com/pulife/local_story_168093853?keyword=secondarystory}}&lt;/ref&gt; using bodyweight exercises like [[push-up]]s, [[squat (exercise)|squats]], [[suspension training]] and [[burpee (exercise)|burpees]], interspersed with [[running]] and competitive games. The idea is that everyone involved works at their own pace as they team up and work towards one goal, either in pairs, small teams of three or four, or even two teams head on.

Boot camps provide [[social support]] for those taking part. This provides a different environment for those exercisers who get bored in a gym and so find it hard to develop a habit of exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/attachments/34033/jssarticle.pdf|title=Effects of Perceived Fitness Level of Exercise Partner on Intensity of Exertion|journal=Journal of Social Sciences|volume=6|issue=1|pages=50–54|year=2010|first1=Thomas G|last1=Plante|first2=Meghan|last2=Madden|first3=Sonia|last3=Mann|first4=Grace|last4=Lee|first5=Allison|last5=Hardesty|first6=Nick|last6=Gable|first7=Allison|last7=Terry|first8=Greg|last8=Kaplow|doi=10.3844/jssp.2010.50.54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants make friends and socialize as they exercise, although how strict the trainers or [[drill instructors]] in charge can be will depend on the company running the camp. Members of fitness boot camps are usually tested for fitness on the first day and then retested at the end of the camp, which usually runs for between 4 and 6 weeks.

Fitness boot camps are often based on the military style of training, although that has started changing over the last few years. An advantage of a boot camp is that the large group dynamic will often help motivate the participants. A growing trend in fitness boot camps are the indoor locations which prove to be climate proof and provide a better workout environment for the members. Additionally, some camps include extracurricular fitness activities off-site.

There are many other benefits of a fitness boot camp, which includes [[mental health]]. It has long been known that regular aerobic exercise can help to reduce [[high blood pressure]], [[hypertension]] and combat [[stress (biology)|stress]]. Part of this is due to the release of [[endorphins]], which act as a mood elevator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bothum, Kelly|title=Fitness boot camp an intense 4 weeks|url=http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070116/ENG11/301160019/-1/NEWS01|work=[[The News Journal]]|date=January 16, 2007|accessdate=May 11, 2009|archive-date=May 29, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529001304/http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070116%2FENG11%2F301160019%2F-1%2FNEWS01|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some "Holistic Bootcamps" provide the mental coaching required to sustain motivation after people leave the camp.

'''General fitness training''' works towards broad goals of overall health and well-being, rather than narrow goals of sport competition, larger muscles or concerns over appearance.  A regular moderate workout regimen and healthy diet can improve general appearance markers of good health such as muscle tone, healthy skin, hair and nails, while preventing age or lifestyle-related reductions in health and the series of heart and organ failures that accompany inactivity and poor diet.

Diet itself helps to increase calorie burning by boosting metabolism, a process further enhanced while gaining more lean muscle. An aerobic exercise program can burn fat and increase the metabolic rate.

== General Fitness ==
There are many benefits to increasing one’s general fitness level, such as a reduction in stress,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Kenneth R.|date=March 1999|title=The influence of physical activity on mental well-being|journal=Public Health Nutrition|volume=2|issue=3a|pages=411–418|doi=10.1017/S1368980099000567|pmid=10610081|issn=1475-2727|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; to feel better, a decreased likelihood of contracting many cardiovascular diseases, etc.. Implementing or emphasizing an increased consistent level of [[physical activity]] is a surefire way to increase general fitness levels. The amount that one must be active and in doing what varies from person to person; for example, [[LeBron James]] has a much different training regimen than [[Judge Judy]].&lt;sup&gt;[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]'']&lt;/sup&gt;

There are also many ways to decrease one’s general fitness level. Injury, stress, tragedy, all of these can cause one to become less active and decreasing your body’s BMR. A general reduction in physical activity will also absolutely cause a decrease in general fitness.

== Diet ==
[[Diet (nutrition)|Diet]] itself helps to increase calorie burning by boosting metabolism, a process further enhanced while gaining more lean muscle. An [[aerobic exercise]] program can burn fat and increase the [[Basal Metabolic Rate|basal metabolic rate (BMR)]] in obese adults, studies show that through proper diet over the span of 6 months in obese adults has shown a positive correlation in fitness and mood, as well as a weight loss average of over 27.5%&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Studies also show reduced level of hunger and several other symptoms, such as inability to get up in the morning and frequent anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McClernon|first=F. Joseph|last2=Yancy|first2=William S.|last3=Eberstein|first3=Jacqueline A.|last4=Atkins|first4=Robert C.|last5=Westman|first5=Eric C.|date=2007|title=The Effects of a Low-Carbohydrate Ketogenic Diet and a Low-Fat Diet on Mood, Hunger, and Other Self-Reported Symptoms|journal=Obesity|volume=15|issue=1|pages=182|doi=10.1038/oby.2007.516|issn=1930-739X|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fitness and Mental Stability ==
Physical fitness and mental stability go hand in hand, as research suggests that although physical and aerobic activity betters ones physical capabilities, it also helps with ones positive body image and self esteem. Studies show that physical fitness helps improve positive body image and self esteem, perceivable increased stress management, reduction of depression and anxiety,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steptoe|first=Andrew|last2=Edwards|first2=Sara|last3=Moses|first3=Jennifer|last4=Mathews|first4=Andrew|date=1989-01-01|title=The effects of exercise training on mood and perceived coping ability in anxious adults from the general population|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|volume=33|issue=5|pages=537–547|doi=10.1016/0022-3999(89)90061-5|issn=0022-3999}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as enhance mood states and improve overall cognitive function.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; This all further shows the importance behind the usage of physical fitness for mental stability and why it is so important to engage in the practice of it.

== Weight loss and Muscle Definition ==
General fitness training may be used to promote weight loss. [[Personal trainer]]s construct a program centered on restructuring lifestyle while helping to provide the necessary motivation for its success.

General fitness training can also be used to promote toning or building of muscles, which are essentially the same physiological process. (However, 'toning' implies moderate muscle definition, whereas 'building' implies increasing musculature significantly.)

The definition of weight loss is losing as much as or more than 3% body weight,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stevens|first=J.|last2=Truesdale|first2=K. P.|last3=McClain|first3=J. E.|last4=Cai|first4=J.|date=March 2006|title=The definition of weight maintenance|journal=International Journal of Obesity|volume=30|issue=3|pages=391–399|doi=10.1038/sj.ijo.0803175|issn=1476-5497|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is no completely defined definition as to what weight loss is, as one must take into account expert opinion, body type, previous study precedents, and normal weight fluctuations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==More Specialized Fitness Training==

===Sports-Specific Training===

Sports-specific trainers can help improve [[physical strength|strength]], [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]] and [[Endurance|stamina]] to improve performance in specific [[sport]]s. Options include increasing arm strength for tennis playing or improve strength and core stability providing better balance playing [[golf]].

Sports specific training is all about developing physical conditions to improve performance and skills at a particular [[sport]]. Also, understanding the needs of the game, training/practicing at the correct pace, in order to meet sports requirements.

'''Injury recovery

Certified personal trainers can contribute significantly and uniquely to recovery and rehabilitation efforts. But personal trainers mainly pick up where physical therapy leaves off.

===Prenatal and Postpartum Training===

During a [[pregnancy]] period a lot of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] is put on the [[muscle]] on the lower back due to the heavy weight being carried. [[Exercise]] and stretching can be extremely important to increase strength and reinforce the body structure for the extra weight.

During the [[second trimester]] (weeks 13-28) the unpleasant symptoms from the first trimester should have settled down and the mother will start to feel a renewed level of [[energy]]. The biggest change during this period will be the growth of the 'bump'. As the baby grows the mother should notice a change in her body position and [[neutral spine|posture]]. The extra weight occurs at the front of the body, the hip and back joints will take the strain. The posture will shift as the [[lower back]] [[muscle]]s tighten and take an exaggerated curvature. The [[abdominal muscles]] will stretch and strain to adapt to the growing baby. During this time it will be extremely beneficial to perform [[exercises]] to help strengthen weakened [[abdominal]] and [[pelvic floor muscles]], in order to reduce the [[Strain (injury)|strain]] on the [[lower back]].

[[File:Amsterdam - Gymnasium - 0591.jpg|thumb|Inside a gymnasium in Amsterdam]]

A '''gymnasium''', also known as a '''gym''', is a covered location for [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletics]]. The word is derived from the [[ancient Greek]] [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|''gymnasium'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Partridge|1984|p=517}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are commonly found in athletic and [[Physical fitness|fitness]] centers, and as activity and [[learning space]]s in educational institutions. "Gym" is also slang for "[[fitness center]]", which is often an area for indoor recreation. A gym may be open air as well. A gym is a place with a number of [[Equipment|equipments]] and [[Machine|machines]] used by the people to do exercises.

==Overview==
[[File:Gville UF Florida Gym01.jpg|thumb|The [[Florida Gymnasium]] at the [[University of Florida]]]]
[[File:TWU Gymnastics (Floor) Floor Warm Up (5694074973).jpg|thumb|Students of [[Texas Woman's University]] practicing in their university gymnasium, 2011]]
[[File:Varpaisjärven liikuntahalli - Kirjastontie 4, Varpaisjärvi - Lapinlahti.jpg|thumb|The Varpaisjärvi Sports Hall in [[Lapinlahti]], [[Finland]]]]
Gymnasia apparatuses such as barbells, jumping board, running path, tennis-balls, cricket field, and fencing area are used as exercises. In safe weather, outdoor locations are the most conducive to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ravenstein|Hulley|1867}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gyms were popular in ancient Greece. Their curricula included  self-defense, gymnastica medica, or physical therapy to help the sick and injured, and for physical fitness and sports, from boxing to dancing to skipping rope.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Partington|1838|p=627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gymnasia also had teachers of wisdom and philosophy. Community gymnastic events were done as part of the celebrations during various village festivals. In ancient Greece there was a phrase of contempt, "He can neither swim nor write." After a while, however, Olympic athletes began training in buildings specifically designed for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Editors|first=History com|title=The Olympic Games|url=https://www.history.com/topics/sports/olympic-games|access-date=2020-09-30|website=HISTORY|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community sports never became as popular among ancient Romans as it had among the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]]. Gyms were used more as a preparation for military service or spectator sports. During the [[Roman Empire]], the gymnastic art was forgotten. In the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] there were sword fighting tournaments and of [[chivalry]]; and after [[gunpowder]] was invented sword fighting began to be replaced by the sport of [[fencing]], as well as schools of dagger fighting and wrestling and boxing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Partington|1838|p=628}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, Salzmann, German clergyman, opened a gym in Thuringia teaching bodily exercises, including running and swimming. Clias and Volker established gyms in London, and in 1825, Doctor Beck, a German immigrant, established the first gymnasium in the United States. It was found that gym pupils lose interest in doing the same exercises, partly because of age. Variety in exercises included skating, dancing, and swimming. Some gym activities can be done by 6 to 8-year-olds while age 16 has been considered mature enough for boxing and horseback riding.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Partington|1838|p=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], the ''[[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasion]]'' (γυμνάσιον) was a locality for both physical and intellectual [[education]] of young men. The latter meaning of intellectual education persisted in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[German language|German]] and other languages to denote a certain type of school providing [[secondary education]], the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], whereas in [[English language|English]] the meaning of physical education pertained in the word 'gym'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gymnasium (Greek) |url=https://www.ancient.eu/Gymnasium/ |website=Ancient Encyclopedia |access-date=1 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Greek word ''gymnasium'', which means "school for naked exercise," was used to designate a locality for the [[education]] of young men, including physical education (''[[gymnastics]]'', for example, exercise) which was customarily performed naked, as well as [[bathing]], and studies. For the Greeks, physical education was considered as important as cognitive learning. Most Greek ''gymnasia'' had libraries that for use after relaxing in the baths.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

[[File:Children's outdoor gymnasium circa 19th Century.jpg|thumb|400px|Children's outdoor gymnasium, circa 19th Century. The equipment, which was standard for the time, includes ladders, gymnastic horses, and parallel bars.]]
The first recorded gymnasiums date back to over 3000 years ago in ancient [[Persia]], where they were known as ''[[Pahlevani and zoorkhaneh rituals|zurkhaneh]]'', areas that encouraged physical fitness. The larger [[Thermae|Roman Baths]] often had attached fitness facilities, the baths themselves sometimes being decorated with [[mosaic]]s of local champions of sport. Gyms in [[Germany]] were an outgrowth of the ''Turnplatz'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-turnplatz-open-air-gymnasium-in-the-hasenheide-1811-48390278.html |title=Stock Photo – Turnplatz (open-air gymnasium) in the Hasenheide, 1811 |last=Limited |first=Alamy |website=Alamy |language=en |access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; an outdoor space for gymnastics founded by German educator [[Friedrich Jahn]] in 1811&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goodbody |first=John |title=The Illustrated History of Gymnastics |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedhisto0000good |url-access=registration |publisher=Stanley Paul &amp; Co. |location=London |year=1982 |isbn=0-09-143350-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later promoted by the [[Turners]], a nineteenth-century political and gymnastic movement. The first American to open a public gym in the United States using Jahn's model was [[John Neal (writer)|John Neal]] of [[Portland, Maine]] in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Leonard | first = Fred Eugene | title = A Guide to the History of Physical Education | publisher = Lea &amp; Febiger | location = Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and New York, New York | year = 1923 | url = https://archive.org/details/guidetohistoryof00leon/ | pages = 227–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first indoor gymnasium in Germany was probably the one built in [[Hesse]] in 1852 by Adolph Spiess.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZy2BgAAQBAJ&amp;q=first+indoor+gymnasium+in+germany&amp;pg=PT9 |title=INTRODUCTION TO PHYSICAL EDUCATION |last=Dalvi |first=Rajani |isbn=9781312161344 |access-date=2019-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through worldwide colonization, Great Britain expanded its national interest in sports and games to many countries. In the 1800s, programs were added to schools and college curricula that emphasized health, strength, and bodily measure. Sports drawn from European and British cultures thrived as college students and upper-class clubs financed competition. As a result, towns began building playgrounds that furthered interest in sports and physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Introduction to physical education, exercise science, and sport studies |last=Lumpkin |first=Angela |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education; 9 edition |date=January 29, 2013 |isbn=978-0-07-802266-1 |page=226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], the Turner movement thrived in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The first Turners group was formed in London in 1848. The Turners built gymnasia in several cities like Cincinnati and [[St. Louis]] which had large [[German American]] populations. These gyms were utilized by adults and youth. For example, a young [[Lou Gehrig]] would frequent the Turner gym in [[New York City]] with his father.

'''Exercise physiology''' is the [[physiology]] of [[physical exercise]]. It is one of the [[allied health professions]] that involves the study of the acute responses and chronic adaptations to exercise.

Understanding the effect of exercise involves studying specific changes in [[muscular]], [[cardiovascular]], and [[Neurology|neuro]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;humoral [[Biological system|systems]] that lead to changes in functional capacity and [[Physical strength|strength]] due to [[endurance training]] or [[strength training]].&lt;ref name="Awtry"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Awtry|first1=Eric H.|title=Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine|last2=Balady|first2=Gary J.|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkin|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7817-7012-5|editor1-last=Topol|editor1-first=Eric J.|editor1-link=Eric Topol|edition=3rd|page=83|chapter=Exercise and Physical Activity|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=35zSLWyEWbcC&amp;pg=PA76}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of training on the body has been defined as the reaction to the adaptive responses of the body arising from exercise&lt;ref name="Bompa"&gt;{{cite book|title=Periodization: Theory and Methodology of Training|last1=Bompa|first1=Tudor O.|last2=Haff|first2=G.

== Energy expenditure==
Humans have a high capacity to expend [[Oxidative phosphorylation|energy]] for many hours during sustained exertion. For example, one individual cycling at a speed of {{convert|26.4|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} through {{convert|8204|km|mi|abbr=on}} over 50 consecutive days expended a total of 1,145 MJ (273,850 kcal; 273,850 dieter calories) with an average power output of 182.5 W.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=19005357|year=2008|last1=Gianetti|first1=G|last2=Burton|first2=L|last3=Donovan|first3=R|last4=Allen|first4=G|last5=Pescatello|first5=LS|title=Physiologic and psychological responses of an athlete cycling 100+ miles daily for 50 consecutive days|volume=7|issue=6|pages=343–7|doi=10.1249/JSR.0b013e31818f0670|journal=Current Sports Medicine Reports}}. This individual while exceptional was not physiologically extraordinary since he was described as "subelite" due to his not being "able to adjust power output to regulate energy expenditure as occurs with elite athletes during ultra-cycling events" page 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeletal muscle burns 90&amp;nbsp;mg (0.5 [[Mole (unit)|mmol]]) of glucose each minute during continuous activity (such as when repetitively extending the human knee),&lt;ref name="Richter, E. A. 1988"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=3284382|year=1988|last1=Richter|first1=EA|last2=Kiens|first2=B|last3=Saltin|first3=B|last4=Christensen|first4=NJ|last5=Savard|first5=G|title=Skeletal muscle glucose uptake during dynamic exercise in humans: Role of muscle mass|volume=254|issue=5 Pt 1|pages=E555–61|journal=The American Journal of Physiology|doi=10.1152/ajpendo.1988.254.5.E555}}&lt;/ref&gt; generating ≈24 W of mechanical energy, and since muscle energy conversion is only 22–26% efficient,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=8923647|year=1996|last1=Bangsbo|first1=J|s2cid=23080799|title=Physiological factors associated with efficiency in high intensity exercise|volume=22|issue=5|pages=299–305|journal=Sports Medicine|doi=10.2165/00007256-199622050-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt; ≈76 W of heat energy.

For short duration muscular exertion, energy expenditure can be far greater: an adult human male when jumping up from a squat can mechanically generate 314 W/kg. Such rapid movement can generate twice this amount in nonhuman animals such as [[bonobo]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=16901837|year=2006|last1=Scholz|first1=MN|last2=d'Août|first2=K|last3=Bobbert|first3=MF|last4=Aerts|first4=P|title=Vertical jumping performance of bonobo (Pan paniscus) suggests superior muscle properties|volume=273|issue=1598|pages=2177–84|doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3568|pmc=1635523|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some small lizards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Curtin NA, Woledge RC, Aerts P | year = 2005 | title = Muscle directly meets the vast power demands in agile lizards | journal = Proceedings: Biological Sciences | volume = 272 | issue = 1563| pages = 581–4 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2004.2982 | pmid = 15817432 | pmc = 1564073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This energy expenditure is very large compared to the basal resting metabolic rate of the adult human body. This rate varies somewhat with size, gender and age but is typically between 45 W and 85 W.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=16277825|year=2005|last1=Henry|first1=CJ|title=Basal metabolic rate studies in humans: Measurement and development of new equations|volume=8|issue=7A|pages=1133–52|journal=Public Health Nutrition|doi=10.1079/phn2005801|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Henry 2005 provides BMR formula various ages given body weight: those for BMR aged 18–30 in MJ/day (where mass is body weight in kg) are: male BMR = 0.0669 mass + 2.28; females BMR = 0.0546 mass + 2.33; 1 MJ per day = 11.6 W. The data providing these formula hide a high variance: for men weighing 70 kg, measured BMR is between 50 and 110 W, and women weighing 60 kg, between 40 W and 90 W.&lt;/ref&gt; Total energy expenditure ([[Total energy expenditure|TEE]]) due to muscular expended energy is much higher and depends upon the average level of physical work and exercise done during a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=16277815|year=2005|last1=Torun|first1=B|title=Energy requirements of children and adolescents|volume=8|issue=7A|pages=968–93|journal=Public Health Nutrition|doi=10.1079/phn2005791|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus exercise, particularly if sustained for very long periods, dominates the energy metabolism of the body.

=== Rapid energy sources ===
Energy needed to perform short lasting, high intensity bursts of activity is derived from [[anaerobic metabolism]] within the [[cytosol]] of muscle cells, as opposed to [[aerobic respiration]] which utilizes oxygen, is sustainable, and occurs in the [[mitochondria]]. The quick energy sources consist of the [[phosphocreatine]] (PCr) system, fast [[glycolysis]], and [[adenylate kinase]]. All of these systems re-synthesize [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), which is the universal energy source in all cells. The most rapid source, but the most readily depleted of the above sources is the PCr system which utilizes the enzyme [[creatine kinase]]. This enzyme catalyzes a reaction that combines [[phosphocreatine]] and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) into ATP and [[creatine]]. This resource is short lasting because oxygen is required for the resynthesis of phosphocreatine via mitochondrial creatine kinase. Therefore, under anaerobic conditions, this substrate is finite and only lasts between approximately 10 to 30 seconds of high intensity work. Fast glycolysis, however, can function for approximately 2 minutes prior to fatigue, and predominately uses intracellular glycogen as a substrate. Glycogen is broken down rapidly via [[glycogen phosphorylase]] into individual glucose units during intense exercise. Glucose is then oxidized to pyruvate and under anaerobic conditions is reduced to lactic acid. This reaction oxidizes NADH to NAD, thereby releasing a hydrogen ion, promoting acidosis. For this reason, fast glycolysis can not be sustained for long periods of time.

=== Plasma glucose ===
Plasma glucose is said to be maintained when there is an equal rate of glucose appearance (entry into the blood) and glucose disposal (removal from the blood). In the healthy individual, the rates of appearance and disposal are essentially equal during exercise of moderate intensity and duration; however, prolonged exercise or sufficiently intense exercise can result in an imbalance leaning towards a higher rate of disposal than appearance, at which point glucose levels fall producing the onset of fatigue. Rate of glucose appearance is dictated by the amount of glucose being absorbed at the gut as well as liver (hepatic) glucose output. Although glucose absorption from the gut is not typically a source of glucose appearance during exercise, the liver is capable of catabolizing stored [[glycogen]] ([[glycogenolysis]]) as well as synthesizing new glucose from specific reduced carbon molecules (glycerol, pyruvate, and lactate) in a process called [[gluconeogenesis]]. The ability of the liver to release glucose into the blood from glycogenolysis is unique, since skeletal muscle, the other major glycogen reservoir, is incapable of doing so. Unlike skeletal muscle, liver cells contain the enzyme [[(glycogen-synthase-D) phosphatase|glycogen phosphatase]], which removes a phosphate group from glucose-6-P to release free glucose. In order for glucose to exit a cell membrane, the removal of this phosphate group is essential. Although gluconeogenesis is an important component of hepatic glucose output, it alone can not sustain exercise. For this reason, when glycogen stores are depleted during exercise, glucose levels fall and fatigue sets in. Glucose disposal, the other side of the equation, is controlled by uptake of glucose at the working skeletal muscles. During exercise, despite decreased [[insulin]] concentrations, muscle increases [[GLUT4]] translocation of and glucose uptake. The mechanism for increased GLUT4 translocation is an area of ongoing research.

'''glucose control''':
As mentioned above, insulin secretion is reduced during exercise, and does not play a major role in maintaining normal blood glucose concentration during exercise, but its counter-regulatory hormones appear in increasing concentrations. Principle among these are [[glucagon]], [[epinephrine]], and [[growth hormone]]. All of these hormones stimulate liver (hepatic) glucose output, among other functions. For instance, both epinephrine and growth hormone also stimulate adipocyte lipase, which increases non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) release. By oxidizing fatty acids, this spares glucose utilization and helps to maintain blood sugar level during exercise.

'''Exercise for diabetes''':
Exercise is a particularly potent tool for glucose control in those who have [[diabetes mellitus]]. In a situation of elevated blood glucose ([[hyperglycemia]]), moderate exercise can induce greater glucose disposal than appearance, thereby decreasing total plasma glucose concentrations. As stated above, the mechanism for this glucose disposal is independent of insulin, which makes it particularly well-suited for people with diabetes. In addition, there appears to be an increase in sensitivity to insulin for approximately 12–24 hours post-exercise. This is particularly useful for those who have type II diabetes and are producing sufficient insulin but demonstrate peripheral resistance to insulin signaling. However, during extreme hyperglycemic episodes, people with diabetes should avoid exercise due to potential complications associated with [[ketoacidosis]]. Exercise could exacerbate ketoacidosis by increasing ketone synthesis in response to increased circulating NEFA's.

Type II diabetes is also intricately linked to obesity, and there may be a connection between type II diabetes and how fat is stored within pancreatic, muscle, and liver cells. Likely due to this connection, weight loss from both exercise and diet tends to increase insulin sensitivity in the majority of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=High-Intensity Intermittent Exercise and Fat Loss|last=Boutcher|first=Stephen H.|date=2011|journal=Journal of Obesity|volume=2011|pages=868305|language=en|doi=10.1155/2011/868305|pmc=2991639|pmid=21113312}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some people, this effect can be particularly potent and can result in normal glucose control. Although nobody is technically cured of diabetes, individuals can live normal lives without the fear of diabetic complications; however, regain of weight would assuredly result in diabetes signs and symptoms.

=== Oxygen ===

Vigorous physical activity (such as exercise or hard labor) increases the body's demand for oxygen. The first-line physiologic response to this demand is an increase in [[heart rate]], [[breathing rate]], and [[deep breathing|depth of breathing]].

Oxygen consumption (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) during exercise is best described by the [[Fick Equation]]: VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=Q x (a-vO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;diff), which states that the amount of oxygen consumed is equal to [[cardiac output]] (Q) multiplied by the difference between arterial and venous oxygen concentrations. More simply put, oxygen consumption is dictated by the quantity of blood distributed by the heart as well as the working muscle's ability to take up the oxygen within that blood; however, this is a bit of an oversimplification. Although cardiac output is thought to be the limiting factor of this relationship in healthy individuals, it is not the only determinant of VO2 max. That is, factors such as the ability of the lung to oxygenate the blood must also be considered. Various pathologies and anomalies cause conditions such as diffusion limitation, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and pulmonary shunts that can limit oxygenation of the blood and therefore oxygen distribution. In addition, the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood is also an important determinant of the equation. Oxygen carrying capacity is often the target of exercise ([[ergogenic aids]]) aids used in endurance sports to increase the volume percentage of red blood cells ([[hematocrit]]), such as through [[blood doping]] or the use of [[erythropoietin]] (EPO). Furthermore, peripheral oxygen uptake is reliant on a rerouting of blood flow from relatively inactive [[viscera]] to the working skeletal muscles, and within the skeletal muscle, capillary to muscle fiber ratio influences oxygen extraction.

=== Dehydration ===
[[Dehydration]] refers both to hypohydration (dehydration induced prior to exercise) and to exercise-induced dehydration (dehydration that develops during exercise). The latter reduces aerobic endurance performance and results in increased body temperature, heart rate, perceived exertion, and possibly increased reliance on carbohydrate as a fuel source. Although the negative effects of exercise-induced dehydration on exercise performance were clearly demonstrated in the 1940s, athletes continued to believe for years thereafter that fluid intake was not beneficial. More recently, negative effects on performance have been demonstrated with modest (&lt;2%) dehydration, and these effects are exacerbated when the exercise is performed in a hot environment. The effects of hypohydration may vary, depending on whether it is induced through diuretics or sauna exposure, which substantially reduce plasma volume, or prior exercise, which has much less impact on plasma volume. Hypohydration reduces aerobic endurance, but its effects on muscle strength and endurance are not consistent and require further study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=10198142|year=1999|last1=Barr|first1=SI|title=Effects of dehydration on exercise performance|volume=24|issue=2|pages=164–72|journal=Canadian Journal of Applied Physiology|doi=10.1139/h99-014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intense prolonged exercise produces metabolic waste heat, and this is removed by [[sweat]]-based [[thermoregulation]]. A male [[marathon]] runner loses each hour around 0.83 L in cool weather and 1.2 L in warm (losses in females are about 68 to 73% lower).&lt;ref name ="cheuvront"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cheuvront SN, Haymes EM| s2cid = 45969661 | year = 2001 | title = Thermoregulation and marathon running: biological and environmental influences | journal = Sports Med | volume = 31 | issue = 10| pages = 743–62 | doi=10.2165/00007256-200131100-00004| pmid = 11547895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People doing heavy exercise may lose two and half times as much fluid in sweat as urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=11385091|year=2001|last1=Porter|first1=AM|title=Why do we have apocrine and sebaceous glands?|volume=94|issue=5|pages=236–7|pmc=1281456|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|doi=10.1177/014107680109400509}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can have profound physiological effects. Cycling for 2 hours in the heat (35&amp;nbsp;°C) with minimal fluid intake causes body mass decline by 3 to 5%, blood volume likewise by 3 to 6%, body temperature to rise constantly, and in comparison with proper fluid intake, higher heart rates, lower stroke volumes and cardiac outputs, reduced skin blood flow, and higher systemic vascular resistance. These effects are largely eliminated by replacing 50 to 80% of the fluid lost in sweat.&lt;ref name ="cheuvront"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=8594004|year=1995|last1=González-Alonso|first1=J|last2=Mora-Rodríguez|first2=R|last3=Below|first3=PR|last4=Coyle|first4=EF|title=Dehydration reduces cardiac output and increases systemic and cutaneous vascular resistance during exercise|volume=79|issue=5|pages=1487–96|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|doi=10.1152/jappl.1995.79.5.1487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brain ==
{{main|Neurobiological effects of physical exercise}}
At rest, the [[human brain]] receives 15% of total cardiac output, and uses 20% of the body's energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=13645234|year=1959|last1=Lassen|first1=NA|s2cid=29275804|title=Cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption in man|volume=39|issue=2|pages=183–238|journal=Physiological Reviews|doi=10.1152/physrev.1959.39.2.183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brain is normally dependent for its high energy expenditure upon [[aerobic metabolism]].

Protecting the brain from even minor disruption is important since exercise depends upon [[motor skill|motor control]]. Because humans are bipeds, motor control is needed for keeping balance. For this reason, brain energy consumption is increased during intense physical exercise due to the demands in the motor cognition needed to control the body.&lt;ref name="Secher, N.

Exercise Physiologists treat a range of neurological conditions including (but not limited to): Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Traumatic Brain Injury, Spinal Chord Injury, Cerebral Palsy and mental health conditions.

=== Glucose ===
In adults, exercise depletes the plasma glucose available to the brain: short intense exercise (35 min ergometer cycling) can reduce brain glucose uptake by 32%.&lt;ref name="Pmid"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=16037089|year=2005|last1=Kemppainen|first1=J|last2=Aalto|first2=S|last3=Fujimoto|first3=T|last4=Kalliokoski|first4=KK|last5=Långsjö|first5=J|last6=Oikonen|first6=V|last7=Rinne|first7=J|last8=Nuutila|first8=P|last9=Knuuti|first9=J|title=High intensity exercise decreases global brain glucose uptake in humans|volume=568|issue=Pt 1|pages=323–32|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.2005.091355|pmc=1474763|journal=The Journal of Physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At rest, energy for the adult brain is normally provided by glucose but the brain has a compensatory capacity to replace some of this with [[lactic acid|lactate]]. Research suggests that this can be raised, when a person rests in a [[Positron emission tomography|brain scanner]], to about 17%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=12796713|year=2003|last1=Smith|first1=D|last2=Pernet|first2=A|last3=Hallett|first3=WA|last4=Bingham|first4=E|last5=Marsden|first5=PK|last6=Amiel|first6=SA|title=Lactate: A preferred fuel for human brain metabolism in vivo|volume=23|issue=6|pages=658–64|doi=10.1097/01.WCB.0000063991.19746.11|journal=Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a higher percentage of 25% occurring during [[hypoglycemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=16144821|year=2006|last1=Lubow|first1=JM|last2=Piñón|first2=IG|last3=Avogaro|first3=A|last4=Cobelli|first4=C|last5=Treeson|first5=DM|last6=Mandeville|first6=KA|last7=Toffolo|first7=G|last8=Boyle|first8=PJ|s2cid=8297686|title= Brain oxygen utilization is unchanged by hypoglycemia in normal humans: Lactate, alanine, and leucine uptake are not sufficient to offset energy deficit|volume=290|issue=1|pages=E149–E153|doi=10.1152/ajpendo.00049.2005|journal=American Journal of Physiology.

Each [[muscle contraction#Skeletal muscle contractions|muscle contraction]] involves an [[action potential]] that activates voltage sensors, and so releases [[Voltage-dependent calcium channel|Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions]] from the [[muscle fibre]]’s [[Sarcoplasmic reticulum#Sarcoplasmic reticulum|sarcoplasmic reticulum]]. The action potentials that cause this also require ion changes:  [[Sodium channel#Voltage-gated|Na influxes]] during the [[depolarization]] phase and K effluxes for the [[repolarization]] phase. [[Chloride channel|Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions]] also diffuse into the sarcoplasm to aid the repolarization phase. During intense muscle contraction, the ion pumps that maintain homeostasis of these ions are inactivated and this (with other ion related disruption) causes ionic disturbances. This causes cellular membrane depolarization, inexcitability, and so muscle weakness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=17962569|year=2008|last1=McKenna|first1=MJ|last2=Bangsbo|first2=J|last3=Renaud|first3=JM|title=Muscle K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Cl disturbances and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pump inactivation: Implications for fatigue|volume=104|issue=1|pages=288–95|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.01037.2007|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; leakage from type 1 [[ryanodine receptor]]) channels has also been identified with fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=18268335|year=2008|last1=Bellinger|first1=AM|last2=Reiken|first2=S|last3=Dura|first3=M|last4=Murphy|first4=PW|last5=Deng|first5=SX|last6=Landry|first6=DW|last7=Nieman|first7=D|last8=Lehnart|first8=SE|last9=Samaru|first9=M|last10=Lacampagne|first10=A.|last11=Marks|first11=A.

=== Endurance failure ===
After intense prolonged exercise, there can be a collapse in body [[Human homeostasis|homeostasis]]. Some famous examples include:
* [[Dorando Pietri]] in the [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Summer Olympic]] [[Athletics at the 1908 Summer Olympics – Men's marathon|men's marathon]] ran the wrong way and collapsed several times.
* [[James Peters (athlete)|Jim Peters]] in the marathon of the [[1954 Commonwealth Games]]  staggered and collapsed several times, and though he had a five-kilometre (three-mile) lead, failed to finish. Though it was formerly believed that this was due to severe dehydration, more recent research suggests it was the combined effects upon the brain of hyperthermia, hypertonic hypernatraemia associated with dehydration, and possibly hypoglycaemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=18928034|year=2008|last1=Noakes|first1=T|last2=Mekler|first2=J|last3=Pedoe|first3=DT|title=Jim Peters' collapse in the 1954 Vancouver Empire Games marathon|volume=98|issue=8|pages=596–600|journal=South African Medical Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gabriela Andersen-Schiess]] in the woman's marathon at the Los Angeles [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in the race's final 400 meters, stopping occasionally and shown signs of [[heat exhaustion]]. Though she fell across the finish line, she was released from medical care only two hours later.

In this, the brain continuously adjusts the power output by muscles during exercise in regard to a safe level of exertion. These neural calculations factor in prior length of strenuous exercise, the planned duration of further exertion, and the present metabolic state of the body. This adjusts the number of activated skeletal muscle motor units, and is subjectively experienced as [[Muscle weakness|fatigue]] and exhaustion.

== Cardiac biomarkers ==
Prolonged exercise such as marathons can increase [[Cardiac marker|cardiac biomarkers]] such as [[troponin]], [[Brain natriuretic peptide|B-type natriuretic peptide]] (BNP), and ischemia-modified (aka MI) [[albumin]]. This can be misinterpreted by medical personnel as signs of [[myocardial infarction]], or [[Acute coronary syndrome|cardiac dysfunction]]. In these clinical conditions, such cardiac biomarkers are produced by irreversible injury of muscles. In contrast, the processes that create them after strenuous exertion in endurance sports are reversible, with their levels returning to normal within 24-hours (further research, however, is still needed).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=18614952|year=2008|last1=Scharhag|first1=J|last2=George|first2=K|last3=Shave|first3=R|last4=Urhausen|first4=A|last5=Kindermann|first5=W|title=Exercise-associated increases in cardiac biomarkers|volume=40|issue=8|pages=1408–15|doi=10.1249/MSS.0b013e318172cf22|journal=Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=18942493|year=2008|last1=Lippi|first1=G|last2=Schena|first2=F|last3=Salvagno|first3=GL|last4=Montagnana|first4=M|last5=Gelati|first5=M|last6=Tarperi|first6=C|last7=Banfi|first7=G|last8=Guidi|first8=GC|title=Influence of a half-marathon run on NT-proBNP and troponin T|volume=54|issue=7–8|pages=251–4|journal=Clinical Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/27/health/nutrition/27best.html The Lab Says Heart Attack, but the Patient Is Fine] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 27 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human adaptations ==
Humans are specifically [[human evolution|adapted]] to engage in prolonged strenuous muscular activity (such as efficient long distance [[Human skeletal changes due to bipedalism|bipedal]] running).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=15549097|year=2004|last1=Bramble|first1=DM|last2=Lieberman|first2=DE|title=Endurance running and the evolution of ''Homo''|volume=432|issue=7015|pages=345–52|doi=10.1038/nature03052|journal=Nature|bibcode=2004Natur.432..345B|s2cid=2470602|url= http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~skeleton/pdfs/2004e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This capacity for endurance running may have evolved to allow the [[Persistence hunting#Persistence hunting in human evolution|running down]] of game animals by persistent slow but constant chase over many hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1086/203165|title=The Energetic Paradox of Human Running and Hominid Evolution|year=1984|last1=Carrier|first1=David R.|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=25|issue=4|pages=483–495|s2cid=15432016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the success of this is the ability of the human body, unlike that of the animals they hunt, to effectively remove muscle heat waste. In most animals, this is stored by allowing a temporary increase in body temperature. This allows them to escape from animals that quickly speed after them for a short duration (the way nearly all predators catch their prey). Humans, unlike other animals that catch prey, remove heat with a specialized [[Thermoregulation#Variations in the temperature of human beings and some animals|thermoregulation]] based on [[sweating|sweat]] evaporation. One gram of sweat can remove 2,598 J of heat energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=5425034|year=1970|last1=Snellen|first1=JW|last2=Mitchell|first2=D|last3=Wyndham|first3=CH|title=Heat of evaporation of sweat|volume=29|issue=1|pages=40–4|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|doi=10.1152/jappl.1970.29.1.40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mechanism is increased skin blood flow during exercise that allows for greater convective heat loss that is aided by our upright posture. This skin based cooling has resulted in humans acquiring an increased number of [[sweat glands]], combined with a lack of [[fur|body fur]] that would otherwise stop air circulation and efficient evaporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=18613867|year=2008|last1=Lupi|first1=O|title=Ancient adaptations of human skin: Why do we retain sebaceous and apocrine glands?|volume=47|issue=7|pages=651–4|doi=10.1111/j.1365-4632.2008.03765.x|journal=International Journal of Dermatology|s2cid=32885875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because humans can remove exercise heat, they can avoid the fatigue from heat exhaustion that affects animals chased in a persistent manner, and so eventually catch them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1086/508695|title=Persistence Hunting by Modern Hunter‐Gatherers|year=2006|last1=Liebenberg|first1=Louis|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=47|issue=6|pages=1017–1026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Selective breeding experiments with rodents ==
Rodents have been specifically bred for exercise behavior or performance in several different studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=20148672|year=2010|last1=Feder|first1=ME|last2=Garland Jr|first2=T|last3=Marden|first3=JH|last4=Zera|first4=AJ|title=Locomotion in response to shifting climate zones: Not so fast|volume=72|pages=167–90|doi=10.1146/annurev-physiol-021909-135804|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|url= http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Feder_et_al_2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, laboratory rats have been bred for high or low performance on a motorized treadmill with electrical stimulation as [[motivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Koch, L. G.|author2= Britton, S. L. |year=2001|title=Artificial selection for intrinsic aerobic endurance running capacity in rats|journal= Physiological Genomics |volume=5|issue= 1 |pages=45–52|pmid= 11161005 |doi= 10.1152/physiolgenomics.2001.5.1.45 |citeseerx= 10.1.1.325.7411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high-performance line of rats also exhibits increased voluntary wheel-running behavior as compared with the low-capacity line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=18304593|year=2008|last1=Waters|first1=RP|last2=Renner|first2=KJ|last3=Pringle|first3=RB|last4=Summers|first4=CH|last5=Britton|first5=SL|last6=Koch|first6=LG|last7=Swallow|first7=JG|title=Selection for aerobic capacity affects corticosterone, monoamines and wheel-running activity|volume=93|issue=4–5|pages=1044–54|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2008.01.013|pmc=2435267|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[experimental evolution]] approach, four replicate lines of laboratory mice have been bred for high levels of [[voluntary exercise]] on wheels, while four additional control lines are maintained by breeding without regard to the amount of wheel running.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=9670598|year=1998|last1=Swallow|first1=JG|last2=Carter|first2=PA|last3=Garland Jr|first3=T|s2cid=18336243|title=Artificial selection for increased wheel-running behavior in house mice|volume=28|issue=3|pages=227–37|journal=Behavior Genetics|doi=10.1023/A:1021479331779}}&lt;/ref&gt; These selected lines of mice also show increased endurance capacity in tests of forced endurance capacity on a motorized treadmill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=19717672|year=2009|last1=Meek|first1=TH|last2=Lonquich|first2=BP|last3=Hannon|first3=RM|last4=Garland Jr|first4=T|title=Endurance capacity of mice selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running|volume=212|issue=18|pages=2908–17|doi=10.1242/jeb.028886|journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in neither selection experiment have the precise causes of fatigue during either forced or voluntary exercise been determined.

== Exercise-induced muscle pain ==
Physical exercise may cause pain both as an immediate effect that may result from stimulation of [[free nerve endings]] by low pH, as well as a [[delayed onset muscle soreness]]. The delayed soreness is fundamentally the result of ruptures within the muscle, although apparently not involving the rupture of whole [[muscle fiber]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nosaka|first=Ken|title=Skeletal muscle damage and repair|editor=Tiidus, Peter M|publisher=[[Human Kinetics]]|year=2008|pages=59–76|chapter=Muscle Soreness and Damage and the Repeated-Bout Effect|isbn=978-0-7360-5867-4|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ueMh1x7kFjsC&amp;pg=PA59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muscle pain can range from a mild soreness to a debilitating injury depending on intensity of exercise, level of training, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cheung|first1=Karoline|last2=Hume|first2=Patria A.|last3=Maxwell|first3=Linda|s2cid=26525519|date=2012-10-23|title=Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness|journal=Sports Medicine|language=en|volume=33|issue=2|pages=145–164|doi=10.2165/00007256-200333020-00005|issn=0112-1642|pmid=12617692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some preliminary evidence to suggest that moderate intensity continuous training has the ability to increase someone's pain threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hakansson|first1=S.|last2=Jones|first2=M. D.|last3=Ristov|first3=M.|last4=Marcos|first4=L.|last5=Clark|first5=T.|last6=Ram|first6=A.|last7=Morey|first7=R.|last8=Franklin|first8=A.|last9=McCarthy|first9=C.|s2cid=49602409|date=2018|title=Intensity-dependent effects of aerobic training on pressure pain threshold in overweight men: A randomized trial|journal=European Journal of Pain|language=en|volume=22|issue=10|pages=1813–1823|doi=10.1002/ejp.1277|pmid=29956398|issn=1532-2149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education in exercise physiology==

Accreditation programs exist with professional bodies in most developed countries, ensuring the quality and consistency of education. In Canada, one may obtain the professional certification title – Certified Exercise Physiologist for those working with clients (both clinical and non clinical) in the health and fitness industry. In Australia, one may obtain the professional certification title - Accredited Exercise Physiologist (AEP) through the professional body [https://www.essa.org.au/ Exercise and Sports Science Australia] (ESSA). In Australia, it is common for an AEP to also have the qualification of an Accredited Exercise Scientist (AES). The premiere governing body is the [[American College of Sports Medicine]].

An exercise physiologist's area of study may include but is not limited to [[biochemistry]], [[bioenergetics]], [[cardiopulmonary]] function, [[hematology]], [[biomechanics]], [[skeletal muscle]] physiology, [[neuroendocrine]] function, and central and peripheral [[nervous system]] function. Furthermore, exercise physiologists range from basic scientists, to clinical researchers, to clinicians, to sports trainers.

Colleges and universities offer exercise physiology as a program of study on various different levels, including undergraduate, graduate degrees and certificates, and doctoral programs.  The basis of Exercise Physiology as a major is to prepare students for a career in field of health sciences.  A program that focuses on the scientific study of the physiological processes involved in physical or motor activity, including sensorimotor interactions, response mechanisms, and the effects of injury, disease, and disability. Includes instruction in muscular and skeletal anatomy; molecular and cellular basis of muscle contraction; fuel utilization; neurophysiology of motor mechanics; systemic physiological responses (respiration, blood flow, endocrine secretions, and others); fatigue and exhaustion; muscle and body training; physiology of specific exercises and activities; physiology of injury; and the effects of disabilities and disease. Careers available with a degree in Exercise Physiology can include: non-clinical, client-based work; strength and conditioning specialists; cardiopulmonary treatment; and clinical-based research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Paul|title=Careers in Exercise Physiology|url=http://www.americankinesiology.org/featured-careers/featured-careers/exercise-physiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to gauge the multiple areas of study, students are taught processes in which to follow on a client-based level. Practical and lecture teachings are instructed in the classroom and in a laboratory setting. These include:

*'''Health and risk assessment''': In order to safely work with a client on the job, you must first be able to know the benefits and risks associated with physical activity. Examples of this include knowing specific injuries the body can experience during exercise, how to properly screen a client before their training begins, and what factors to look for that may inhibit their performance.
*'''Exercise testing''':  Coordinating exercise tests in order to measure body compositions, cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength/endurance, and flexibility. Functional tests are also used in order to gain understanding on a more specific part of the body. Once the information is gathered about a client, exercise physiologists must also be able to interpret the test data and decide what health-related outcomes have been discovered.
*'''Exercise prescription''':  Forming training programs that best meet an individuals health and fitness goals. Must be able to take into account different types of exercises, the reasons/goal for a clients workout, and pre-screened assessments. Knowing how to prescribe exercises for special considerations and populations is also required. These may include age differences, pregnancy, joint diseases, obesity, pulmonary disease, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=American College of Sports Medicine|title=ACSM's guidelines for exercise testing and prescription|year=2010|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-6903-7|edition=8th|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780781769037}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum===

The curriculum for exercise physiology includes [[biology]], [[chemistry]], and [[applied sciences]]. The purpose of the classes selected for this major is to have a proficient understanding of human anatomy, human physiology, and exercise physiology. Includes instruction in muscular and skeletal anatomy; molecular and cellular basis of muscle contraction; fuel utilization; [[neurophysiology]] of motor mechanics; systemic physiological responses (respiration, blood flow, endocrine secretions, and others); fatigue and exhaustion; muscle and body training; physiology of specific exercises and activities; physiology of injury; and the effects of disabilities and disease. Not only is a full class schedule needed to complete a degree in Exercise Physiology, but a minimum amount of practicum experience is required and internships are recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=University|first=Ohio|title=Class Requirements|url=http://www.ohio.edu/chsp/ahsw/academics/exphu.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USMC-05301.jpg|thumb|A [[US Marine]] performs plyometric jumps in [[Camp Foster]], [[Okinawa]]]]

'''Plyometrics''', also known as '''jump training''' or '''plyos''', are exercises in which [[muscle]]s exert maximum force in short intervals of time, with the goal of increasing power (speed-strength). This training focuses on learning to move from a muscle [[Extension (kinesiology)|extension]] to a [[Muscle contraction|contraction]] in a rapid or "explosive" manner, such as in specialized repeated jumping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chu|first=Donald|title=Jumping into plyometrics|url=https://archive.org/details/jumpingintoplyom0002chud|url-access=registration|year=1998|publisher=Human Kinetics|location=Champaign, IL|isbn=978-0880118460|pages=[https://archive.org/details/jumpingintoplyom0002chud/page/1 1–4]|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plyometrics are primarily used by [[Sportsperson|athletes]], especially [[martial arts|martial artists]], sprinters and [[high jump]]ers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://athleteculture.com/training/an-athletes-guide-to-jumping-higher-vertical-jump-secrets-uncovered/|title=An Athlete's Guide to Jumping Higher: Vertical Jump Secrets Uncovered!|last=Starks|first=Joe|date=25 April 2013|publisher=Athlete Culture|access-date=30 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511071908/http://athleteculture.com/training/an-athletes-guide-to-jumping-higher-vertical-jump-secrets-uncovered/|archive-date=11 May 2013|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; to improve performance,&lt;ref name="Yessis"&gt;{{cite book |author= Michael Yessis |title=Explosive Plyometrics |publisher=Ultimate Athlete Concepts|year=2009 |isbn=978-098171806-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are used in the fitness field to a much lesser degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doctoryessis.com/2013/01/02/why-is-plyometrics-so-misunderstood-and-misapplied/|title=Why is plyometrics so misunderstood and misapplied?|last=Yessis|first=Michael|publisher=doctoryessis.com|access-date=3 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Plyometrics includes explosive exercises to activate the quick response and elastic properties of the major muscles. It was initially adopted by Soviet Olympians in the 1950s, and then by sportspeople worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.verkhoshansky.com/Portals/0/Presentations/Shock%20Method%20Plyometrics.pdf |title=Shock Method and Plyometrics: Updates And An In-Depth Examination}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sports using plyometrics include basketball, tennis, badminton, squash and volleyball as well as the various codes of football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ultrafitnessmag.com.au/Train/Ground/tabid/4592/entryid/457/RUNNING-STRONG-INTRODUCING-PLYOMETRICS.aspx|title=RUNNING STRONG, INTRODUCING PLYOMETRICS|website=Fitness PRO Magazine|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "plyometrics" was coined by [[Fred Wilt]] after watching Soviet athletes prepare for their events in track and field.&lt;ref name="Wilt"&gt;Wilt, Fred &amp; Yessis, Michael. ''Soviet Theory, Technique and Training for Running and Hurdling.'' Vol 1. Championship Books, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  He began a collaboration with trainer [[Michael Yessis]] to promote plyometrics.

Since its introduction in the early 1980s, two forms of plyometrics have evolved. In the original version, created by Russian scientist Yuri Verkhoshansky, it was defined as the shock method.&lt;ref name="Verkhoshansky1966"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Yuri Verkhoshansky|title=Perspectives in the Improvement of Speed-Strength Preparation of Jumpers|journal=Legkaya Atletika(Track and Field)|volume=9|pages=11–12|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Verkhoshanski2"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Yuri Verkhoshanski|title=Are Depth Jumps Useful?|journal= Legkaya Atletika (Track and Field)|volume=12|pages=9|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this, the athlete would drop down from a height and experience a "shock" upon landing. This in turn would bring about a forced [[eccentric contraction]] which was then immediately switched to a [[concentric contraction]] as the athlete jumped upward. The landing and takeoff were executed in an extremely short period of time, in the range of 0.1–0.2 second.&lt;ref name="Verkhoshanski2" /&gt; Explosive plyometrics describes the approach originally created by Verkhoshansky.&lt;ref name="Yessis" /&gt; He experimented with many different exercises, but the depth jump appeared to be the best for duplicating the forces in the landing and takeoff.

The second version of plyometrics, seen to a greater extent in the [[United States]], involves any form of jump regardless of execution time.

==Etymology==
The term plyometric is a combination of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots that means to increase measurement—''plio-'' means "more" and ''metric'' means "length".

''Plyo-'' comes from the Greek word ''plythein'', which means “to increase.” ''Plio'' is the Greek word for “ore,” and metric literally means “to measure.”&lt;ref&gt;Voight M.L., &amp; Tippett S.R.  (2013). Plyometric exercise in rehabilitation. Hoogenboom B.J., &amp; Voight M.L., &amp; Prentice W.E.(Eds.),  ''''Musculoskeletal Interventions: Techniques for Therapeutic Exercise, Third Edition''''. McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|History of physical training and fitness}}

[[Fred Wilt]], a former [[US Olympic]] [[long-distance runner]], is credited with coining the term plyometrics. He admits that it is not a very good term, but it was the best he could come up with after watching the [[Russians]] execute jumps in their warm-ups prior to their event in [[track and field]]. He could not understand why the Russians were doing all of these jumps while the Americans were doing multiple static stretches, but he firmly believed it was one of the reasons why they were so successful in many events.&lt;ref name="Wilt" /&gt;
From its beginnings in the early 1980s, the term plyometrics gained greater popularity and is now well established.  When Fred Wilt learned of the work being done by [[Michael Yessis]] in the field of Russian training methods, they quickly teamed up to help disseminate information on plyometrics.

In collaboration with Yessis who visited and worked with Verkhoshansky&lt;ref&gt;McCadam, K., "Russian Training Legend: Dr. Yuri Verkhoshansky." Retrieved online April 22, 2012 from http://www.pushtheground.com/2011/06/russian-traning-legend-dr-yuri.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927082151/http://www.pushtheground.com/2011/06/russian-traning-legend-dr-yuri.html |date=2013-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Soviet Union in the early 1980s, plyometrics was gradually disseminated in the US. Yessis brought this information on plyometrics back to the US and in the following years was able to create even more ways of using this method to train and improve explosive power. 
  
Plyometrics (the shock method) was created by Yuri Verkhoshansky in the late 1960s, early 1970s.&lt;ref name="Verkhoshanski2" /&gt; Since then, the shock method of plyometrics is still being practiced for improvement of athletic performance by what appears to be a relatively limited number of athletes. These athletes still do depth jumps, the key exercise in the shock method, according to the guidelines established by Verkhoshansky.

Most athletes execute simple and complex jumps and call them plyometrics rather than jump training as it was called in the past.  This includes the depth jump which was executed in ways different from what was recommended by Verkhoshansky.  This form of jump training is very popular but plyometrics is a buzzword for all types of jumps, regardless of how long it takes to execute the jump. Its use is so pervasive that it is even possible to find push-ups described as being plyometric.

Due to the wide use and appeal of the term plyometrics, the true meaning of plyometrics as developed by  Verkhoshansky has for the most part been forgotten. Verkhoshansky was well known and respected worldwide in both the scientific and in the coaching arenas.  He was relatively unknown in the United States except for some of his articles that were translated and published in the''Soviet Sports Review'', later called the ''Fitness and Sports Review International''.

In addition to creating the shock method, Verkhoshansky is credited with developing the stretch-shortening concept of muscle contractions and the development of specialized (dynamic correspondence) strength exercises. Plyometrics, or more specifically the shock method, is considered a form of specialized strength development.

Before undertaking plyometric training, it is necessary to distinguish jumps that are commonly called plyometric and true plyometric jumps as exemplified in the depth jump which is illustrative of the shock method. Since its inception in the former Soviet Union as the shock method, there have been other forms of the plyometric exercises created by Yessis that do not involve jump exercises.  For details and illustrations of these exercises see "Explosive Running"&lt;ref name="Yessis2000"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Yessis |title=Explosive Running |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.; 1st edition |year=2000 |isbn=978-0809298990 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/explosiverunning0000yess }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Explosive Plyometrics".&lt;ref name="Yessis" /&gt;  These exercises involve the stretch-shorten concept that underlies the shock method.

==Method==
In the depth jump, the athlete experiences a shock on landing in which the hip, knee, and ankle extensor muscles undergo a powerful eccentric contraction. For the muscles to respond explosively, the eccentric contraction is then quickly switched to the isometric (when the downward movement stops) and then the concentric contraction, in a minimum amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A.S. Medvedev |author2=V.V. Marchenko |author3=S.V. Fomichenko |title=Speed-Strength Structure of Vertical Jumps by Qualified Weightlifters in Different Take-off Conditions (Condensed)|journal=Soviet Sports Review International-Teoriya I Praktika Fizicheskoi Kultury|volume=19|pages=164–167|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows the athlete to jump upward as high as possible.
  
In the eccentric contraction, the muscles are involuntarily lengthened, while in the concentric contraction, the muscles are shortened after being tensed.  Most of the stretching and shortening takes place in the tendons that attach to the muscles involved rather than in the muscles.  
To execute the depth jump, the athlete stands on a raised platform, usually not greater than {{convert|20|-|30|in|cm}} high, and then steps out and drops down in a vertical pathway to make contact with the floor.  The height used by most athletes is usually quite low in the early stages of training.  The key is how high the athlete jumps in relation to the height of the takeoff platform.  Technique and jump height are most important at this time.  
While the body is dropping, the athlete consciously prepares the muscles for the impact by tensing the muscles.  The flooring upon which the athlete drops down on should be somewhat resilient, mainly for prevention of injury. Upon making contact with the floor, the athlete then goes into slight leg flex to absorb some of the force for safety.  However, the main role played by the muscles and tendons is to withstand the force that is experienced in the landing.  This force is withstood in eccentric contraction.  When muscle contraction is sufficiently great, it is able to stop the downward movement very quickly.

This phase is sometimes called the phase of amortization in which the athlete absorbs some of the force and stops downward movement by the strong eccentric contraction of the muscles. The strong eccentric contraction prepares the muscles to switch to the concentric contraction in an explosive manner for takeoff.

When the athlete drops down to the floor, the body experiences an impact upon landing. The higher the height of the step-off platform, the greater the impact force upon landing.  This creates a shock to the body which the body responds to by undergoing a strong involuntary muscular contraction to prevent the body from collapsing on the ground. This in turn produces great tension in the muscles and tendons which is then given back in a return upward movement. The faster the change in the muscular contractions, the greater the power created and the resulting height attained.&lt;ref name="Verkhoshanski2" /&gt;

More specifically, the muscles and tendons undergo a stretch (eccentric contraction) while landing which is needed to absorb some of the force generated but most importantly, to withstand the force that is produced by the shock that occurs on the landing. The greater the shock (forces experienced on landing), the stronger the eccentric contraction will be, which in turn produces even greater tension.  This tension, which is potential force, is then given back in the return movement when the muscular contractions switch to the concentric or shortening regime.&lt;ref name="Yessis" /&gt;

However, for maximum return of energy, minimum time must elapse from when the force is received to when they are returned. The greater the time between receiving the forces and giving them back, the less is the return and the less the height that can be achieved in the jump.  Most of the lengthening and shortening occurs in the respective muscle tendons which have greater elasticity.

Another way of saying this is that the faster the switching from the eccentric to the concentric contraction, the greater will be the force produced and the greater the return movement.  The speed of the switching is extremely fast, 0.20 seconds or less.  For example, high-level sprinters execute the switch from the eccentric contraction that occurs when the foot hits the ground to the concentric contraction when the foot breaks contact with the ground in less than 0.10 seconds.  In world-class sprinters, the time is approximately 0.08 seconds.
The exact platform height used by most athletes in the depth jump should be less than {{convert|30|in|cm}} in the early stages of training.  Most athletes start at approximately {{convert|12|in|cm}} after doing some jump training. They then gradually work up to {{convert|20|in|cm}} and then to 30 inches depending upon how well the jumps are executed. The main criterion is that the athlete is jumping as high as possible on every jump.

If the athlete gradually improves his jump height, the same platform height is continued until increases in jump height are no longer observed. At this time, takeoff height is increased by a few inches. If the athlete continually fails to jump very high, the height of the drop-down is lowered somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N.I. Volkov |author2=V.M. Koryagin |title=Systematization of Special Basketball Exercises (Condensed)|journal=Yessis Review of Soviet Physical Education and Sports|volume=13 #4|pages=110–111|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most important here is how high the athlete jumps after the drop-down.

The maximum platform height used by a high level athlete is no more than {{convert|40|in|cm}}.  Rather than developing greater explosive power this height leads to more eccentric strength development.  Going higher than {{convert|30|in|cm}} is usually counterproductive and may lead to injury.  This occurs when the intensity of the forced involuntary eccentric contraction upon landing is greater than the muscles can withstand.  In addition, the athlete will not be able to execute a quick return (fast transition between muscular contractions), which is the key to successful execution of explosive plyometrics.

Because of the forces involved and the quickness of execution, the central nervous system is strongly involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N.A. Masalgin |author2=Y.V. Verkhoshansky |author3=L.L. Golovina |author4=A.M. Naraliev |title=The Influence of the Shock Method of Training on the Electromyographic Parameters of Explosive Effort|journal=Teoriya I Praktika Fizicheskoi Kultury (Theory and Practice of Physical Culture)|volume=1|pages=45–46|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important that the athlete not overdo using the shock plyometric method.  Doing so will lead to great fatigue, and, according to Verkhoshansky, sleep disturbances.&lt;ref name="Dr. Yuri Verkhoshansky, Natalia Verkhoshansky 2011"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Yuri Verkhoshansky |author2=Natalia Verkhoshansky |title=Specialized Strength and Conditioning, Manual For Coaches|publisher=Verkhoshansky SSTM|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Athletes have great difficulty sleeping well if they execute too many depth jumps. This indicates that athletes must be well-prepared physically before doing this type of training.&lt;ref name="Dr. Yuri Verkhoshansky, Natalia Verkhoshansky 2011"/&gt;

Technique of jumping is also very important when executing plyometric exercises. In essence, the athlete goes into a slight squat (crouch) upon landing in which the hip, knee, and ankle joints flex.  The takeoff or jump upward is executed in a sequence initiated by hip-joint extension followed by knee-joint extension which begins during the hip-joint extension.  As the knee-joint extension is taking place, ankle-joint extension begins and is the only action that occurs as the takeoff (breaking contact with the ground) takes place.  All three actions contribute force to the upward jump, but the knee-joint extension is the major contributor.&lt;ref name="Yessis2000" /&gt;

==As simple jumping==

The most common type of plyometrics used in the United States is simple and relatively easy jump exercises executed with little regard to execution time. These jumps are effective for athletes who execute skills in their sport that do not require explosive type muscular contractions. An example is long-distance running in which the runners execute repeat actions of 20 to 30 consecutive jumps and other cyclic-type activities such as leaping for multiple repetitions.&lt;ref name="Yessis2000" /&gt;

Such plyometric jumps are also used as a warm-up for doing explosive plyometric jumps and for initial preparation of the muscles prior to undertaking exercises such as depth jumps.  In essence, they are effective in the early stages of learning how to do plyometric exercises and for preparing the muscles for explosive or quick jumps.  These jumps are similar to those done by youngsters in the playground or in neighborhood games and as such, do not require additional preparation.  Athletes, regardless of their level of expertise, can undertake such jumps in the initial stages of training.

When athletes who have been doing plyometrics without regard to time of execution first attempt to execute explosive plyometrics, they often fail because the time of execution is too long.  This occurs quite often in the depth jump.  The athlete usually sinks (drops) too low which takes too long to make the transition from the eccentric to the concentric contraction.  As a result, the exercise becomes a jump-strength exercise and not a true plyometric one.

Jump technique remains the same regardless of whether it is a true plyometric exercise or a jump exercise. The hips, knees, and ankles flex when landing and the joints extend on the upward return. The sequence and overlapping in the sequence is basically the same, beginning with the hip extension, followed by knee extension, and ending with the ankle-plantar flexing.  The major differences in execution are the depth of the landing and the time of executing the switch from the eccentric to the concentric contraction.

Studies have been conducted testing ten various plyometric exercises on overall performance during jumping examined by EMG, power, and ground reaction force (GRF). Of the ten exercises, the single-leg cone hops, box jumps, tuck jumps, and two-legged vertical jumps produced the highest EMG values, alluding to greater motor recruitment. Power was examined in dumbbell jumps, depth jumps, countermovement jumps, squat jumps, and tuck jumps which all produced the higher power scale readings. In terms of athletic performance and training, the plyometric movements that utilize total body vibration produced an overall increase in performance output. A recent study examined two groups using the same plyometric protocol in combination with [[weight training]], one using high loads and the other utilizing small loads, and similar decreases in power were found. This shows that the  plyometric exercises themselves had a greater effect in the decrease in power output rather than the type of weight training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ebben | first1 = W.

==Safety considerations==
Plyometrics have been shown to have benefits for reducing lower extremity injuries in team sports while combined with other neuromuscular training (i.e. strength training, balance training, and stretching). Plyometric exercises involve an increased risk of injury due to the large force generated during training and performance, and should only be performed by well conditioned individuals under supervision. Good levels of [[physical strength]], [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]], and [[proprioception]] should be achieved before beginning plyometric training.

The specified minimum strength requirement varies depending on where the information is sourced and the intensity of the plyometrics being performed. Chu (1998) recommends that a participant be able to perform 50 repetitions of the [[Squat (exercise)|squat exercise]] at 60% of his or her body weight before doing plyometrics. Core (abdomen) strength is also important.

Flexibility is required both for injury prevention and to enhance the effect of the [[stretch shortening cycle]]. Some advanced training methods combine plyometrics and intensive stretching in order to both protect the joint and make it more receptive to the plyometric benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Marc De Bremaeker (2013). ''Plyo-Flex''. {{ISBN|978-1938585104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Proprioception]] is an important component of balance, coordination and agility, which is also required for safe performance of plyometric exercises.

Further safety considerations include:

* Age: should be taken into account for both prepubescent and the elderly because of hormonal changes.
* Technique: a participant must be instructed on proper technique before commencing any plyometric exercise. He or she should be well rested and free of injury in any of the limbs to be exercised.

Plyometrics are not inherently dangerous, but the highly focused and intense movements used in repetition increase the potential level of stress on joints and musculo-tendonous units. Therefore, safety precautions are strong prerequisites to this particular method of exercise. Low-intensity variations of plyometrics are frequently utilized in various stages of injury rehabilitation, indicating that the application of proper technique and appropriate safety precautions can make plyometrics safe and effective for many people.

== Benefits ==

Many professional and Olympic athletes use plyometrics training to improve muscular strength and jumping abilities which therefore increases their power. There are  varying levels of intensity to plyometrics. Another benefit of plyometrics is that you can vary your level of intensity which means anyone looking to improve strength and jumping training can be involved regardless of fitness. With there being so many exercises this means you are less likely to get burned out and have a wide range of exercises to choose from. Another good reason with so many exercises being available are that you can find exercises that don’t require the use of any equipment. It also increases muscular strength and endurance, also increases metabolic rate which increases weight loss and heart rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://health.alot.com/wellness/pros-of-the-plyometrics-workout--1050|title=Pros of the Plyometrics Workout|date=2015-02-18|website=Alot Health|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Loaded plyometrics ==

Plyometric exercises are sometimes performed with an additional load, or weight, added. The weight is held or worn. The additional weight may be in the form of a barbell, trap bar, dumbbells, or weighted vest. For instance, a vertical jump whilst holding a [[Trapbar|trap bar]] or jumping split squats whilst holding dumbbells. In addition, a regular weight lifting exercise is sometimes given a plyometric component, such as is found in a loaded jump squat. Jumping onto boxes or over hurdles whilst holding weights is not recommended for safety reasons. The advantage of loaded plyometric exercises is that they increase the overall force with which the exercise is performed. This can enhance the positive effect of the exercise and further increase the practitioner's ability to apply explosive power.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Derek, Kennelly, Steve, 'Equipment' in ''Plyometric Anatomy'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="28480" xml:space="preserve">[[File:Box Jump Power Training.png|thumb|A box jump being performed in a gym. Plyometrics are a basic and effective power training exercise which require little or no equipment. Jumping with the addition of weights, such as [[dumbbells]] or a [[trap bar]], can lead to an even greater ability to perform powerfully.]]
'''Power training''' typically involves exercises which apply the maximum amount of force as fast as possible; on the basis that strength + speed = power.&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Michael, 'Power' in ''Oxford Dictionary of Sports Science &amp; Medicine'', Oxford: OUP, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Jumping with weights or throwing weights are two examples of power training exercises. Regular [[weight training]] exercises such as the clean and jerk and power clean may also be considered as being power training exercises due to the explosive speed required to complete the lifts. Power training may also involve contrasting exercises such as heavy lifts and plyometrics, known as complex training, in an attempt to combine the maximal lifting exertions with dynamic movements. This combination of a high [[strength training|strength exercise]] with a high speed exercise may lead to an increased ability to apply power. Power training frequently specifically utilises two physiological processes which increase in conjunction with one another during exercise. These are deep breathing, which results in increased intra-abdominal pressure; and post-activation potentation, which is the enhanced activation of the nervous system and increased muscle fibre recruitment. Power training programmes may be shaped to increase the trainee's ability to apply power in [[General physical preparedness|general]], to meet [[Specific physical preparedness|sports specific]] criteria, or both.

==Specific forms of power training==
There are various forms of power training which may be used singularly or in combination with one another.

===Plyometrics and loaded plyometrics===
[[Plyometric]] training typically involves jumping exercises; these exercises may begin from the feet only or also involve taking off from the hands such as is found in a plyometric push up. Plyometric may also refer to exercises which involve similar quick movements of the body in a repetitive manner, such as repeatedly throwing a [[medicine ball]] in the air, catching it, and throwing it up again and so forth. Usually, an exercise is considered plyometric or not based upon its speed, the rapidity of its repetitions, and the extent to which it utilises the body's stretch-shortening cycle. This cycle is where a muscle may be considered to alternately lengthen (an eccentric action) and then shorten (a concentric action) in quick succession during a repetition. The performance of repetitive jumps and sprinting both clearly emphasise the [[stretch shortening cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Michael, 'Plyometrics' in ''Oxford Dictionary of Sports Science &amp; Medicine'', Oxford: OUP, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Loaded plyometrics refers to the addition of a load, or weight, to jumping exercises. Jumping up and down with a trap bar for instance, or with a barbell held over the head. Loaded plyometrics may increase explosive power more so than unloaded plyometrics.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Derek, Kennelly, Steve, 'Equipment' in ''Plyometric Anatomy'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Two people can also [[Calisthenics#Co-operative calisthenics|co-operate]] in order to perform loaded plyometric exercises. For example, one person can carry the other on their back while they jump or hop.

===Ballistic training===
[[File:Ballistic training medicine ball throw.jpg|thumb|Ballistic training consisting of throwing medicine balls. Note the preparatory crouched posture which [[Power training#Isometric presses and explosive power movements|preloads]] the legs and core; this helps to increase the power of the throw.]]
[[Ballistic training]] is based upon maximising the acceleration phase of an object and minimising the deceleration phase. This may involve throwing a weight, as the term ballistic implies, but may also involve jumping whilst holding a weight or swinging a weight. Examples include throwing a medicine ball, jumping with a trap bar, or swinging a weighted club.&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, Steven J. &amp; William J., Kraemer, 'Ballistic Training' in ''Designing Resistance Training Programmes'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, 2013, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex training===
[[Complex training]], sometimes referred to as contrast training, involves alternating heavy lifts with plyometric exercises. Ideally, the exercises should move through similar ranges of motion. For example, a set of back squats at about 85-95% [[1RM]] followed by a set of vertical jumps. The intention is to utilise the PAP effect from the heavy back squats in the jumping exercises and thereby increase the power with which the jumps are performed with.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Steven J. Fleck &amp; Kraemer, William J., 'Complex Training, or Contrast Loading' in ''Designing Resistance Training Programmes'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, 2013, p.253&lt;/ref&gt; Over a period of training, this may increase the trainee's ability to perform the plyometric exercise more powerfully without the preceding heavy lift being required.

===Contrast loading===
Contrast loading involves the alternation of heavy and light loads in weight training exercises. The light lifts should be considerably lighter than the heavy lifts. For example, a bench press exercise at about 85-95% 1RM followed by a set at about 30-60% 1RM. The heavy lifts should be performed fast with the lighter lifts being performed as fast as possible. The joints should not be locked as this inhibits muscle fibre recruitment and reduces the speed at which the exercise can be performed. Weighted jumps or a throwing exercise may take the place of the lighter lifts.&lt;ref&gt;McGuigan, Mike, 'Contrast Training' in ''Developing Power'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, 2017, pp. 196–197&lt;/ref&gt;

===Explosive power lifts===
[[File:Olympic lift snatch wikipedia.jpg|thumb|This elite level performance of the [[snatch (weightlifting)|snatch]] demonstrates the explosive power that is required to move the bar overhead. This would be unachievable at a slower speed.]]
Explosive power lifts are weight training exercises which require a very fast movement to be performed by the lifter in order to lift the weight. For instance, in a [[power clean]], a [[barbell]] is quickly lifted from the floor and unto the upper chest; this must be performed fast in one dynamic movement otherwise it would not be possible to move the weight to this position. Similarly, in a [[clean and jerk]], a lifter moves a barbell to a position above their head whilst they quickly lower their height to allow for the easier extension of their arms; this movement must be performed in one very quick fluid action. If the lifter attempted to press the weight above their head slowly then they would not be able to. It is the dramatic increase in speed which allows for the lift to be completed and it is therefore an essential component.

===Gymnastics===
[[File:Pommel horse 6526 (30930743636).jpg|thumb|A gymnast using a pommel horse. Traditionally this specific exercise is only performed by male gymnasts.]]
[[Gymnastic]] exercises may be considered as being [[calisthenic]] in nature with a particular focus on achieving high levels of speed, rhythm and co-ordination. In addition to developing overall power and endurance, they are excellent for developing the strength and mobility of the core and joints. In a study of the power output of gymnasts, Monem Jemni attests that the high peak-power outputs gymnasts are capable of place them near the top level for power athletes; notably, higher than elite level wrestlers.&lt;ref&gt;Jemni, Monem, 'Power output of gymnasts' in ''The Science of Gymnastics'', London: Routledge, 2011, p.11-12&lt;/ref&gt; 
Gymnastic exercises include the [[pommel horse]], [[Rings (gymnastics)|rings]], [[parallel bars]], [[vault (gymnastics)|vaulting]] with the use of apparatus, and various forms of [[dance]] and [[somersaults]].

===Sprint training===
Sprint training is usually meant in regard to [[sprint (running)|running]] but may also include [[cycling]] or [[swimming]]. It is an effective means of training the body to be able to perform faster for longer. As well as increasing technical proficiency in that form of sprint, it also develops overall power, cardiovascular capacity, and muscular endurance. The benefits of sprint training in terms of developing a greater power output can therefore help in the performance of other explosive power movements.&lt;ref&gt;Combine Sprints and Weight Training for Accelerated Gains https://breakingmuscle.com/fitness/combine-sprints-and-weight-training-for-accelerated-gains Retrieved 22 August 2019&lt;/ref&gt; It will usually be included in any comprehensive power training regime.

==Related physiological processes==
===Deep breathing and intra-abdominal pressure===
During exercise a person breathes deeper in order to meet higher oxygen requirements. This adoption of a deeper [[breathing]] pattern also serves a secondary function of strengthening the core of the body. This strengthening effect occurs because the [[thoracic diaphragm]] adopts a lower position than it does than when at rest; this generates increased intra-abdominal pressure which helps to strengthen the [[lumbar spine]] and the core of the body overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hanslindgren.com/articles/diaphragm-function-for-core-stability/|title=Diaphragm function for core stability » Hans Lindgren DC|website=hanslindgren.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, taking a deep breath, or adopting a deeper breathing pattern, is a fundamental requirement when lifting heavy weights.

===Post-activation potentiation (PAP)===
{{quote|The term post-activation potentiation is used to describe the increased performance or power output after performing a strength exercise.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}
During exercise [[the nervous system]] becomes increasingly active and an increased number of [[muscle fibres]] are recruited in order to aid the performance of the exercise. This effect is especially apparent during the lifting of heavy weights. Subsequently, to the performance of the exercise, the increased nervous system activation and recruitment of muscle fibres continues for a period of time; this is referred to as post-activation potentiation, or the PAP effect, and may lead to an increased ability to apply power.&lt;ref&gt;Steven J. Fleck &amp; Kraemer, William J., ‘Complex Training, or Contrast Loading’ in ''Designing Resistance Training Programmes'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, 2013, p.253&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a light weight is lifted, and then a heavy weight is lifted, and then the same light weight is lifted again, then the light weight will feel lighter the second time it is lifted; this is due to the PAP effect from the heavy lift. In complex training the PAP effect may be used to perform plyometric exercises more powerfully, or in contrast loading to perform resistance based exercises more powerfully. Ultimately, the usage of it in a training regime is to condition the trainee to perform with a heightened nervous system activation and increased muscle fibre recruitment; thereby resulting in the ability to move more powerfully as a standard.

==Universal elements of power training==
===Core strength===
The body's [[core (anatomy)|core]], sometimes referred to as the [[torso]], helps all other movements of the body. In power movements this is especially the case as the core musculature is increasingly recruited in order to provide additional power. A stronger core also improves a person's ability to [[Balance (ability)|balance]]. The most effective core strength training involves all parts of the core being strengthed. This may involve bending and straightening in all directions ([[Flexion|flexing]] and [[Extension (anatomy)|extending]]), circular movements ([[Rotation (anatomy)|rotation]] and [[Circumduction (anatomy)#Other|circumduction]]), and holding [[Isometric exercise|isometric]] poses. Additional resistance may be added as required. Generally, the more comprehensive the training is the greater the benefits to a person's ability to apply power; notably, this is partially due to avoiding the problem of disproportionately weak core muscles hindering the power output of strong core muscles that they are working in conjunction with.&lt;ref&gt;Contreras, Bret, 'Core' in ''Bodyweight Strength Training Anatomy'', Champaign: Human Kinetics, 2014, pp.55-58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joint strength===
A large amount of power can only be applied if the [[joints]] are strong enough to be able to cope with it and transfer it. If a joint is too weak then the power that can be applied by and through that joint is necessarily limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxlifemagazine.com/how-flexibility-affects-strength-vice-versa/|title=How Flexibility Affects Strength (&amp; Vice Versa) - BoxLife Magazine|first=William|last=Imbo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is especially the case in dynamic movements which require the rapid application of force to an external object and the absorption of impact forces by the body. For instance, a [[Sprint (running)|sprinter]] must have strong ankle joints in order for their foot to be able to apply leverage and transfer force to the ground, and also to help to absorb any impact forces when the foot is placed. Due to the requirements of any given stride, the ankle must be strengthened in all ranges of movement, including twisting. This can be achieved by running backwards and sideways as well as forwards, or by hopping up and landing facing a different direction for example. A boxer would also need strong ankles but they would also have the added requirement of strong wrists in order to be able to transfer the power of their body adequately to their fists and hence to the target. An example of a wrist strengthening exercise is a one-handed barbell deadlift exercise, which requires increased utilisation of the wrist in order to stabilise the bar. Strong and [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexible]] joints also help to prevent injury. If a joint is injured or excessively weak then it will inhibit the amount of power that it can cope with and transfer, and thereby inhibit movement i.e. a person with a sprained ankle cannot walk properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Villa-Forte |first1=Alexandra |title=Difficulty Moving |url=https://www.msdmanuals.com/en-gb/home/bone,-joint,-and-muscle-disorders/symptoms-of-musculoskeletal-disorders/difficulty-moving |website=MSD Manual Consumer Version |accessdate=16 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proportions of strength===
[[File:Ene Franca Idoko.jpg|thumb|150px|Trained for speed. This sprinter's powerfully developed glutes, thighs, hamstrings and core help her to generate power effectively both in her initial isometric press at the starting blocks and throughout the race.]]
The body most efficiently produces power when its strength producing areas exist in particular proportions. If these proportions exist in the correct ratio to each other, then power generation can be optimised. Conversely, if one area is too strong, this may mean that it is disproportionately strong relative to other areas of the body. This may cause a number of problems: a weaker area of the body may be excessively strained by working in conjunction with the stronger area; and the stronger area may be slowed by working with the weaker area. Such problems hinder power development.

The optimum proportions of strength for power generation may be non-sports specific and based upon an ability to perform more powerfully in general, or sports specific and based upon the requirements of a particular sport. For example, a sprint cyclist may incorporate heavy back squats into their training regime in order to increase their leg strength, which can in turn help them to generate more power on the bike. However, this may lead to excessive leg strength being developed relative to their core strength. This may hinder any improvement to performance and increase the risk of injury. As such, they may incorporate forms of core training which helps them to perform their back squat more efficiently and reduce the risk of injury. The improved performance of the back squat would also mean it was more beneficial to the cycling action.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, Harvey, 'Correct amount of strength' in ''Explosive Lifting for Sports'', Leeds:Human Kinetics, 2010, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;  In such examples the performance of the specific sport or exercise can be improved by ensuring that the involved areas of the body are trained to be in particular proportions of strength, as considered relatively to each other. It is notable that the performance of the sport or exercise alone does not necessarily lead to the body developing in its optimum proportions of strength in order to perform them more powerfully. As stated previously, this result is achieved with the aid of supplementary exercises which optimally influence the body's proportions of strength so a more powerful performance can be achieved.

==Isometric presses and explosive power movements==
Immediately prior to performing a powerful movement the body instinctively performs an [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometric preload]]: this generates force in the muscles which adds to the power of the subsequent dynamic movement. A fundamental element of this preloading is an isometric press action. An everyday example is when a person gets up off a chair. The person raises their posterior off the chair and forms an isometric press, involving the downward force of their torso onto their bent legs, which push upwards with an equal amount of force. From this point the person then stands up. The isometric press which was generated by the torso and the legs helped them to preload their muscles so as to aid the subsequent move to stand up fully. A more dynamic example of this process can be found in a vertical jump. In this case, the jumper crouches down, generates an isometric press involving the downward force of their torso and the upward force of their bent legs, before powering upwards into the jump.&lt;ref&gt;Sharkey, Brian J. &amp; Gaskill, Steven E. 'Preload and Elastic Recoil' in ''Fitness and Health'', Champaign:Human Kinetics, 2007, p.169&lt;/ref&gt; Isometric presses may also be adapted to suit sports specific requirements, such as in boxing. Here, a boxer may position their bodyweight primarily over their bent lead leg before throwing a lead hook. The force generated by the isometric press, involving the downward force of the torso and the upward force of the lead leg, is channelled into the subsequent punch making it more powerful.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, Jack, 'Stance' in ''Championship Fighting Explosive Punching and Aggressive Defense'', 1950&lt;/ref&gt; In athletic events such as sprinting, deliberate apparatus, called [[starting blocks]], are used so the sprinters can perform a more powerful isometric press and channel this additional power into their first strides forwards: this ability to perform an enhanced isometric press allows them to start faster. Isometric presses may be performed faster or slower and in a variety of different ways but all perform the same role of isometrically preloading the muscles so a subsequent dynamic movement can be performed more powerfully. For this reason, isometric presses feature strongly in sports and athletics. The force they can generate can be increased and their instinctive use can be encouraged through the training of the respective actions required to form them (e.g. [[Leg raise#Weighted variations|knee raises]], [[sit-ups]], [[Squat (exercise)|squats]], [[Plyometrics|jumps]]) and the associated musculature (e.g. [[glutes]], [[thighs]], [[hamstrings]], [[Core (anatomy)|core]]). In terms of a person's direct utilisation of isometric presses as a power generation method, this is achieved as part of their instinctive and intuitive performance of isometric preloads, and their further deliberate intensification of them.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==The sport of powerlifting==
Power training and the sport of [[powerlifting]] should be distinguished from one another, although there are some areas where they overlap. Powerlifting, as a sport, is often considered in regard to the three main lifts competitions are judged upon. These are the [[back squat]], the [[deadlift]], and the [[bench press]]. These exercises would not ordinarily be considered as power training exercises because they are not usually performed fast enough. The sport of powerlifting acquires its name due to the great amount of force that is required to lift very heavy weights. A major difference between the sport and power training is that in powerlifting competitions it is often required that the joints are locked for a lift to be registered as complete, whereas this would not usually be possible in power training because it would drastically inhibit the dynamic nature of the movements and lead to injury.

*In terms of loaded plyometrics and ballistic training, jumping with weights, either handheld or in the form of armour, and throwing the discus and javelin featured as part of sport and military training regimes in [[Ancient Greece]]. Amongst the heaviest known throws in antiquity, was a one handed overhead throw of a stone weighing 140&amp;nbsp;kg and which had a handle, by the Ancient Greek, [[Bybon]]. The record of this throw, which is sometimes translated as a lift, is inscribed onto the stone itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, Waldo, ''Early Sport and Recreation in Ancient Greece: A Sourcebook with Translations'', Oxford: OUP, 1987, p.104&lt;/ref&gt; Throwing a stone was also a popular pastime and military training method in the Medieval ages, with records of it including numerous depictions of a one-handed throw of a stone, roughly the size of a person's head, from the shoulder.

*[[Persian people#History|Ancient Persian]] and [[Pehlwani|Indian wrestlers]] used to swing heavy wooden clubs, called [[Indian clubs|Meels]] in Persian, or stone-topped wooden clubs, called [[Gada (mace)|gadas]] in India, in order to develop power. Notably, such exercises help to build strong and flexible joints. In religious contexts, the god or person who is representative of the theme of strength is often associated with a club or club-like object. For example, [[Hanuman]] has a gada, [[Hercules]] has a club, [[Thor]] a hammer, and [[St. Christopher]] a staff.
 
*In a similar vein to contrast loading, the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] trained with weapons which were double the weight of ordinary weapons, in order that when they used the ordinary weapons they would feel lighter and easier to use.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, Lesley &amp; Adkins, Roy A., ''Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome'', New York: Facts on File, 2004, p.81&lt;/ref&gt;

*Gymnastics, in the form of [[acrobatics]], [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]] and [[rhythmic gymnastics|rhythmic dance]], were practiced widely in Ancient Greece (and with especial devotion in [[Sparta]]), Rome, and [[medieval Europe]] for the purposes of leisure, sport and military training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=Dio |title=The New Gymnastics for Men, Women, and Children |date=1868 |publisher=Ticknor and Fields |edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carter |first1=Ernestine |last2=Orlofsky |first2=Fred |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company, Inc. |publication-date=1971 |publication-place=Belmont, California |title=Beginning Tumbling and Floor Exercise |year=1971 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780534006464 |url-access=registration |chapter=History |isbn=9780534006464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In terms of heavy lifts, as a test of strength and manhood various societies, such as [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[North Germanic peoples|Nordic]] ones, used to practice [[stone lifting]]. This involved lifting very heavy stones, usually over 100&amp;nbsp;kg, either up to their waist or onto their shoulder. Two examples are the Menzies stone (115&amp;nbsp;kg) in Scotland and the Husafell Stone (190&amp;nbsp;kg) in Iceland.

{{for|a squat thrust with an extra standing/jumping step|Burpee (exercise)}}
[[File:Christina Kaun squat thrust.jpg|thumb|Staff Sgt. Christina Kaun performs a squat thrust exercise at [[Moody Air Force Base]] in 2009.]]
The '''squat thrust''' is a [[calisthenics|calisthenic]] [[physical exercise|exercise]]. It typically is performed as follows:

# Bend your knees and drop into a [[squat position]], then fall forward, placing your hands on the ground, into the push-up position.
# Throwing your feet back, fall forward into a push-up position.
# Again pull the feet forward to a squat position with hands on the floor.

This series of steps should be repeated many times. Performing the exercise quickly maximizes its effectiveness.

A variation is the alternate leg or split-squat thrusts. This is performed by starting in the same position as the normal squat thrust and then splitting the legs in motion; keeping on your toes during the exercise, take one leg from the rear, up towards the chest in a smooth motion, once the foot of this leg reaches the ground, the other leg should then start to come up towards the chest, and at the same time the leading leg should go back to the starting position.

      <text bytes="5143" xml:space="preserve">'''Circuit training''' is a form of body conditioning that involves [[endurance training]], [[resistance training]], high-intensity [[aerobics]], and exercises performed in a circuit, similar to [[High-intensity interval training]]. It targets strength building and muscular endurance. An exercise "circuit" is one completion of all set exercises in the program. When one circuit is complete, one begins the first exercise again for the next circuit. Traditionally, the time between exercises in circuit training is short, often with rapid movement to the next exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportireland.ie/Coaching-Ireland/Publications-/Circuit-Training.pdf|title=CIRCUIT TRAINING.

==Effects of circuit training==
Studies at Baylor University and The Cooper Institute show that circuit training is the most time efficient way to enhance cardiovascular fitness and muscle endurance. Studies show that circuit training helps women to achieve their goals and maintain them longer than other forms of exercise or diet.&lt;ref name="Curves"&gt;Heavin, Gary and Colman, Carol, C. Reprint edition (December 7, 2004). ''Curves: Permanent Results Without Permanent Dieting'', {{ISBN|0-399-52956-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A summary of one study noted the following:&lt;ref name="UNM" /&gt;
{{quote|
Perhaps a most profound finding of this study, from a health perspective, is that this investigation clearly shows that performance of this circuit of exercises,this level of intensity elicited oxygen consumption values (39% to 51.5% of VO2max) that meet established guidelines of the [[American College of Sports Medicine]] (ACSM) for the recommended intensity (40% to 85% of [[VO2max]]R) of exercise for developing and maintaining cardio-respiratory fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klika|first=Brett|title=High-Intensity Circuit Training Using Body Weight: Maximum Results With Minimal Investment|url=http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2013/05000/HIGH_INTENSITY_CIRCUIT_TRAINING_USING_BODY_WEIGHT_.5.aspx#P98 |publisher=ACSM's Health &amp; Fitness Journal|access-date=20 September 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this circuit not only provides a suitable muscular fitness stimulus but also helps to meet ACSM cardiovascular guidelines and the newly published Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 for physical activity.
}}

One advantage is that reduced station times will encourage the participants to lift heavier weights, which means they can achieve overload with smaller number of repetitions: typically in the range of 25 to 50 depending on their training goals.&lt;ref name="ACSM"&gt;http://westvalley.edu/academics/pe_department/physical_education/programs/weighttraining/acsm-resistancetraining.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
