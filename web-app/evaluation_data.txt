Who was the defending champion of Mr. Olympia in 2020?|Brandon Curry|Going into the 2020 Mr. Olympia, the defending champion, Brandon Curry, had two objectives.One was to beat seven-time champion Phil Heath, which he had never done before.The second was to obviously repeat as the winner of the Sandow.The Tennessee native went one for two.He did place ahead of Heath who came in third, but he lost the title to the new champion, Mamdouh "Big Ramy" Elssbiay.No one wants to lose, but Curry can see what happened, and it serves as an opportunity.He could now become the second man to regain the title after he lost it.That feat has only been pulled off by Jay Cutler in 2009.What does that mean for Curry?As he explained to Bob Cicherillo and Shawn Ray on the April 26th episode of Monday Night Muscle, he will have to go all in this year, but people that have followed his career knows that is something he isn't afraid of."Just as my bodybuilding career has always been, there's more work to do.We're strategizing for this year to take out the champ for this year."If he wants to defeat the current champion, he will have to do things differently this time around as well.Even though the Olympia is in October, Curry is aware now of what the overall plan is to be his all-time best in Orlando, FL."The strategy is to be bigger," he says."The game has kind of changed the standard a little bit with Big Ramy.
What does processed meat refer to?|meat with preservatives or additives in it|It's no shocker when new studies surface about potential health risks associated with eating processed meat.After all, the link between processed meats and diseases such as cancer has made headlines for years.If you find yourself asking, "What is processed meat and what makes it so unhealthy?"you're not alone.After all, a good portion of the foods we normally consume are processed, but don't pose health risks.A recent study led by Hamilton scientists has found a link between eating processed meat and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and early death.The study did not find the same link with unprocessed red meat or poultry.If you're looking to have a better understanding of what processed meat is, or wish to make healthier meat choices, look no further!Processed Meat Explained  Although there is no formal definition of processed meat, "it generally refers to meats that have been smoked, salted, cured, or have preservatives or other additives" explains Sue Heikkinen, a registered dietician at MyNetDiary.Traditionally served as a way to preserve and reduce the risk of food-borne illness, the most common types of processed meats include hot dogs, sausage, ham, bacon, pepperoni, and deli meats.While all meat is processed to some degree, these types of highly-processed meats contain additives like nitrates, and high levels of salt, pose the most health risks.Unfortunately, this goes for lean, white meat at the deli counter such as sliced turkey or chicken also.
When should I eat carbs?|around training windows|Or do you favor a more consistent carb intake from day to day?Lower fiber, or more "processed" carbs can be used pre- and post-workout if desired to help with speeding recovery and nutrient delivery.This would include fast-digesting carbs like white rice or bread, or more "sugary" carbs like bananas, oranges, and packaged snack foods like goldfish crackers.For someone who's possibly on a lower-carb diet, or who's carb cycling from day to day, I would focus on getting most of those carbohydrates around training windows, taking into consideration schedule, sleep times, personal comfort level, etc.
What exercise targets rear delts?|Reverse Pec-Deck|Perform the exercise with a show and consistent tempo.Reverse Pec-Deck:  The rear delts can be a challenging area to isolate.Baye pulls the handles as far back as he can to maximize the contraction and establish the mind-muscle connection.Barbell Shrug:  Shrugs target the traps which can be trained with either the shoulders or the back.Using a barbell allows you to use more volume and target the upper and middle portion of the traps.
What's the best strategy to lose weight?|taking in fewer calories|The Basic Strategy  The best weight loss strategy involves getting into and staying in negative caloric balance by taking in fewer calories and increasing caloric expenditure with exercise.Successful dieting is a long process, and you shouldn't expect much in the way of results for at least a few weeks.Along with exercising to expend calories (cardio activity) you also benefit most by doing resistance bodybuilding training to build and shape the body, to maintain or even increase lean body mass.Why the Process Is Different for Women  As stated above, while certain basics are the same no matter who you are or why you're dieting, there are certain differences between the male and female body that need to be addressed.Women tend to be smaller than men, carry more water weight and fat cells, and have only about 50 percent of the body muscle mass of males of comparable size.They also carry more of their fat and water weight below the waist in comparison to a man.And whereas men tend to lose fat around his midsection last when dieting, women often lose in this area first and it is their hips, thighs and rear ends that lose fat last.Hormone Changes  The predominant hormone in the male body is testosterone.In women its estrogen, which tends to increase the amount of fat and water contained in the female body.However, as a woman ages -- particularly after age 30 -- estrogen levels begin to diminish.
